'''IBus''' (Intelligent Input Bus) is an open source input framework for Linux and Unix.

== Installation ==
Except for the basic IBus framework, one or more engines should be installed. For example:
{{emerge|ibus ibus-pinyin}}
Have a look at the [[eix]] output for more available engines:
{{cmd|eix -c ibus -I app-i18n}}

For graphical toolkit integration, {{package|app-i18n/ibus}} offers gtk (this refers to gtk+:2) and gtk3 useflags, and there is a separate {{package|app-i18n/ibus-qt}} package for [[Qt]] (including [[KDE]]) as well. '''Don't forget to install this latest package if you are a KDE/QT user''' 

You can use {{package|app-i18n/im-chooser}} for selecting your preferred input method. As for now all im-chooser packages are marked unstable, though.

If nothing starts (no ibus daemon) when you log in, you can use put this in your .xprofile file :
{{File|~/.xprofile||<pre>export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
ibus-daemon -drx
</pre>}}

You can finely tune the installation by running 
{{cmd|ibus-setup}} for setting your preferred input methods and the system keyboard you use, as well as whether you want an icon in the taskbar
{{cmd|qtconfig}} to tell Qt ibus is now your input method.
