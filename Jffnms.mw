<!--T:1-->
This guide shows you how to proceed with the post installation setup of Jffnms, a network management and monitoring system, and how to monitor your systems with it.

== Jffnms Basics == <!--T:2-->

=== Introduction === <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
[http://www.jffnms.org Jffnms] is a network management and monitoring system. It allows you to grab information from many different kinds of hosts and protocols. With this guide, we aim to show you how to get Jffnms properly installed and have your systems monitored by this amazing tool. 

== Initial Setup == <!--T:5-->

=== Choosing your USE flags === <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
The Jffnms ebuild has the following USE flags available: 

<!--T:8-->
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left;" 
|- 
! USE Flags for Jffnms
! Description
|- 
| <code>mysql</code>
| Uses Mysql to store Jffnms data
|- 
| <code>postgres</code>
| Uses PostgreSQL to store Jffnms data
|- 
| <code>snmp</code>
| Adds support for snmp, which enables jffnms to gather data from other hosts.
|-
|}

=== USE flags for PHP === <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
Being written in PHP, Jffnms is heavily dependent on PHP USE flags. In order to install Jffnms successfully, you are required to have your PHP package installed with (at least) the following USE flags: 

<!--T:11-->
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left;" 
|- 
! USE Flags for PHP
! Description
|- 
| <code>gd</code>
| Adds support for media-libs/gd (to generate graphics on the fly)
|- 
| <code>wddx</code>
| Adds support for Web Distributed Data eXchange
|- 
| <code>sockets</code>
| Adds support for tcp/ip sockets
|- 
| <code>session</code>
| Adds persistent session support
|- 
| <code>spl</code>
| Adds support for the Standard PHP Library
|- 
| <code>cli</code>
| Enable CLI SAPI
|-
|}

=== Installation === <!--T:12-->

<!--T:13-->
Just like any package in Portage, jffnms can be installed with <code>emerge</code> : 

<!--T:14-->
{{RootCmd|emerge jffnms}}

<!--T:15-->
Jffnms should be installed in {{Path|/opt/jffnms/}}. 

=== Configuring Apache 2 === <!--T:16-->

<!--T:17-->
{{Warning|This very basic configuration procedure for Apache does not cover all aspects of setting up a web server.}}

<!--T:18-->
Sometimes you will want to run Jffnms on your local computer instead of a remote server. If this is your case, it is very likely that you don't have an apache setup running. Don't worry about installing apache though, Portage has already done that for you. Nevertheless, you still have to configure and test apache, which (luckily) is pretty straightforward. Start by adding Apache to your default runlevel: 

<!--T:19-->
{{RootCmd|rc-update add apache2 default}}

<!--T:20-->
If you haven't done it yet, it's time to start apache2: 

<!--T:21-->
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/apache2 start}}

<!--T:22-->
Finally, point your browser at [http://localhost/ http://localhost/] and you should be presented with a home page about your newly installed Apache 2. Now that we know that Apache is up and running, we can proceed to the mod_php configuration. Fire up your favorite text editor, open {{Path|/etc/conf.d/apache2}} and add <code>-D PHP5</code> the APACHE2_OPTS variable. 

<!--T:23-->
{{File|/etc/conf.d/apache2||<pre>
APACHE2_OPTS="-D DEFAULT_VHOST -D PHP5"
</pre>
}}

<!--T:24-->
After that, you should create a symlink to the Jffnms install directory in your Apache document root dir. In Gentoo, by default, Apache uses {{Path|/var/www/localhost/htdocs}} as document root. So, you should do the following: 

<!--T:25-->
{{RootCmd|cd /var/www/localhost/htdocs && ln -s /opt/jffnms/}}

=== Configuring PHP === <!--T:26-->

<!--T:27-->
Now that Apache is running, it is time to configure PHP. Jffnms requires that you set some variables in php.ini in order to run. The {{Path|php.ini}} file is usually located in {{Path|/etc/php/apache2-php5/php.ini}} . You have to set these variables to the following values: 

<!--T:28-->
{{File|/etc/php/apache2-php5/php.ini||<pre>
register_globals = On
register_argc_argv = On 
error_reporting  =  E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE
allow_url_fopen = On
include_path = ".:/usr/share/php5:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/php/PEAR"
short_open_tag = On
</pre>
}}

=== Database setup === <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
{{Warning|Please note again that this a very basic configuration procedure for any database system and does not cover all aspects of setting up such systems.}}

<!--T:31-->
Jffnms allows you to use either PostgreSQL or MySQL as its database. Here we'll show you how to create the database and necessary tables where Jffnms will store its data. It's important to note that it isn't necessary to have a database running locally to run Jffnms and except for the fact that you need to run this commands on the remote host, the procedure is the same. 

=== Setting up PostgreSQL === <!--T:32-->

<!--T:33-->
{{Note|If you already have a PostgreSQL database up and running, you can proceed to the [[#use-pg]] .}}

<!--T:34-->
You should add PostgreSQL to your default runlevel so it's started each time you boot your computer. Make sure to change <code>${SLOT}</code> to your PostgreSQL slot, such as 9.1 or 9.2. 

<!--T:35-->
{{RootCmd|rc-update add postgresql-${SLOT} default}}

<!--T:36-->
Now you must setup the PostgreSQL database. Make sure to change <code>${VERSION}</code> to your PostgreSQL version, such as 9.0.9 or 9.1.5. 

<!--T:37-->
{{RootCmd|emerge --config postgresql-server-${VERSION}}}

<!--T:38-->
Now start PostgreSQL: 

<!--T:39-->
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postgresql-${SLOT} start}}

=== Using PostgreSQL as database === <!--T:40-->

<!--T:41-->
Once you have your PostgreSQL set up and running, you have to create a Jffnms user and a database to store host data. 

<!--T:42-->
{{Cmd|psql template1 postgres}}

<!--T:43-->
{{Cmd|create user jffnms password 'jfnms' createdb;|prompt=template1{{=}}# 
|\connect template1 jffnms
|create database jffnms;
|\q}}

<!--T:44-->
Finally, you need to create all the tables where data will be stored: 

<!--T:45-->
{{Cmd|psql jffnms jffnms < /opt/jffnms/docs/jffnms-0.9.3.pgsql}}

<!--T:46-->
Once you have run those steps, the PostgreSQL database configuration for Jffnms should be ok. 

=== Using MySQL as database === <!--T:47-->

<!--T:48-->
{{Warning|Installing and configuring a MySQL database is not covered in this guide. Please see our [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/MySQL/Startup_Guide MySQL Startup Guide] .}}

<!--T:49-->
In case you want to run Jffnms with MySQL, you'll first need to create a database and a MySQL user. After that, create your MySQL table: 

<!--T:50-->
{{Cmd|mysql -u jffnms -pjffnms jffnms < /opt/jffnms/docs/jffnms-0.9.3.mysql}}

=== UDP Port Monitoring and discovery === <!--T:51-->

<!--T:52-->
{{Warning|This section covers setting up and running suid programs, so it may not be adequate for systems where security is too much an issue.}}

<!--T:53-->
If you want UDP port monitoring and discovery, you need to set <code>nmap</code> and <code>fping</code> as a SUID programs. This may give you security hole in case there's a bug in one of them. To set them as a SUID you can run the following commands: 

<!--T:54-->
{{RootCmd|chmod +s /usr/bin/nmap ; chmod a+x /usr/bin/nmap
|chmod +s /usr/sbin/fping ; chmod a+x /usr/sbin/fping}}

== Configuring Jffnms == <!--T:55-->

=== Configuring the poller process === <!--T:56-->

<!--T:57-->
The poller process is responsible for gathering data from hosts. In order to collect this data at regular intervals, it must be added to crontab. 

<!--T:58-->
{{RootCmd|crontab -u jffnms /opt/jffnms/docs/unix/crontab
|crontab -e -u jffnms}}

=== Final setup === <!--T:59-->

<!--T:60-->
By now, Jffnms should be correctly installed on your system. You still need, however, to configure Jffnms. Luckily, Jffnms provides us with an easy to use web page where it's possible to configure access to database, user access as well as check if the current host configuration suffices Jffnms needs. You can access this web interface through the following URL: [http://localhost/jffnms/admin/setup.php http://localhost/jffnms/admin/setup.php] . You can login to your new installation by using the username and password <code>admin</code> . You should visit [http://www.jffnms.org/ Jffnms's home page] for details on how to properly configure it. 

== Support == <!--T:61-->

<!--T:62-->
Though Jffnms is a wonderful application, it is a bit hard to get it up and running. So if you run into problems with Jffnms, there are some places where you can look for help:
