''initramfs'' is a root filesystem which is embedded into the kernel and loaded at an early stage of the boot process. It is the successor of ''initrd''. It provides early userspace which lets you do things that the kernel can't easily do by itself during the boot process.

Using ''initramfs'' is optional. By default, the kernel initializes hardware using built-in drivers, mounts the specified root partition, loads the init system of the installed Linux distribution. The init system then loads additional modules and starts services until it finally allows you to log in. This is a good default behaviour and sufficient for many users. ''initramfs'' is for users with advanced requirements, for users who need to do things as early as possible, before the root partition is mounted.

Here are some examples of what you can do with ''initramfs'':

* Mount the root partition (for encrypted, logical, and otherwise special partitions)
* Provide a minimalistic rescue shell (if something goes wrong)
* Customize the boot process (e.g. print a welcome message, boot splash, ...)
* Load modules (e.g. a third party driver that can not be integrated into the kernel directly)
* Anything the kernel can't do (as long as you can do it in user space, e.g. by executing commands)

If you don't have advanced requirements, you do not need ''initramfs''.

== Prerequisites ==

There are countless ways to make an ''initramfs''. You can choose not to create an ''initramfs'' at all but let other apps, such as [[Genkernel]] or [[Dracut]], do the work for you. If you are lucky, one of them does what you want out of the box, and you don't need to bother with how ''initramfs'' works and what it does anymore. If you're unlucky, they don't do what you want and you have to extend their functionality, or even build an ''initramfs'' all by yourself.

The ''initramfs'' usually contains at least one file, {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}. This file is executed by the kernel as the main init process (PID 1). It has to do all the work. In addition, there can be any number of additional files and directories that are required by {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}. They are usually files you will also find on any other root filesystem, such as {{Path|/dev}} for device nodes, {{Path|/proc}} for kernel information, {{Path|/bin}} for binaries, and so on. The structure of the ''initramfs'' can be simple, or it can be complicated, depending on what you are planning to do.

When the kernel mounts the ''initramfs'', your target root partition is not yet mounted, so you can't access any of your files. That means there is nothing but the ''initramfs''. So everything you need, everything you want, you have to include it in your ''initramfs''. If you want a shell, you have to include it in your ''initramfs''. If you want to mount something, you need a mount utility. If you need to load a module, your ''initramfs'' has to provide both the module, as well as a utility to load it. If the utility depends on libraries in order to work, you have to include the libraries as well. This seems complicated, and it is, because the ''initramfs'' has to function independently.

== Basics ==

In this section you will learn the ''easy and straightforward way to initramfs creation''. You will make a functional - albeit minimalistic - ''initramfs'' which you then can extend according to your own requirements.

=== Directory Structure ===

Create the directory that will later become your ''initramfs'' root. For consistency. we'll work in {{Path|/usr/src/initramfs}}, but any directory would do. Create the ''initramfs'' root directory and cd into it.

{{RootCmd|mkdir /usr/src/initramfs}}
{{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/initramfs}}

Create a basic directory layout.

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p bin dev etc lib lib64 mnt/root proc root sbin sys}}

==== Device Nodes ====

Most things you do in ''initramfs'' will require a couple of device nodes to be present, especially the device for your root partition. Throughout this document, {{Path|/dev/sda1}} will be used as example device. Copy basic device nodes.

{{RootCmd|cp -a /dev/{null,console,tty,sda1} /usr/src/initramfs/dev/}}

Which devices you need exactly depends entirely on what you are going to use ''initramfs'' for. Please adapt to your own needs.

{{Note|More advanced approaches to device nodes are covered later on in the [[#Dynamic_Devices|Dynamic Devices]] section.}}

=== Applications ===

Any binary you want to execute at boot needs to be copied into your ''initramfs'' layout. You also need to copy any libraries that your binaries require. To see what libraries any particular binary requires, use the tool {{Highlight|'''ldd'''}}. An example examining what libraries {{Package|dev-util/strace}} requires:

{{Cmd|ldd /usr/bin/strace|output=<pre>
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff271ff000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f5b954fe000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f5b958a9000)
</pre>}}

Here you see that for {{Path|/usr/bin/strace}} to work in your ''initramfs'', you not only need to copy {{Path|/usr/bin/strace}} to your {{Path|/usr/src/initramfs/bin}}, but also {{Path|/lib64/libc.so.6}} and {{Path|/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2}} to your {{Path|/usr/src/initramfs/lib64}}. Note that you don't need the {{Path|linux-vdso.so.1}}.

Additionally, some applications may be depend on other files and libraries to work. For example, {{Package|app-editor/nano}} also needs a terminfo file {{Path|/usr/share/terminfo/l/linux}} from {{Package|sys-libs/ncurses}}, so that has to be copied to your ''initramfs'' as well. To find these dependencies, tools like {{Highlight|'''equery'''}} and {{Highlight|'''strace'''}} prove to be helpful.

==== Busybox ====

Instead of collecting countless utilities and libraries (and never seeing the end of it), you can just use {{Package|sys-apps/busybox}}. It's a set of utilities for rescue and embedded systems, it contains a shell, utilities like ls, mkdir, cp, mount, insmod, and many more - all in a single binary called {{Path|/bin/busybox}}. For busybox to work properly in a ''initramfs'', you'll firstly need to emerge it with the '''static''' USE flag enabled, then copy the {{Path|/bin/busybox}} binary into your ''initramfs'' layout as {{Path|/usr/src/initramfs/bin/busybox}}:

{{RootCmd
|<nowiki>USE="static" emerge -av busybox</nowiki>
|cp -a /bin/busybox /usr/src/initramfs/bin/busybox}}

{{Note|Check with {{Highlight|'''ldd'''}} that you're copying a static binary.}}

=== Init ===

The file structure of your ''initramfs'' is almost complete. The only thing that is missing is {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}, the executable in the root of the ''initramfs'' that is executed by the kernel once it is loaded. Because {{Package|sys-apps/busybox}} includes a fully functional shell, this means you can write your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} binary as a simple shell script (instead of making it a complicated application written in Assembler or C that you have to compile).

The following example realizes this executable as a minimalistic shell script, based on the busybox shell:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
#!/bin/busybox sh

# Mount the /proc and /sys filesystems.
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys

# Do your stuff here.
echo "This script mounts rootfs and boots it up, nothing more!"

# Mount the root filesystem.
mount -o ro /dev/sda1 /mnt/root

# Clean up.
umount /proc
umount /sys

# Boot the real thing.
exec switch_root /mnt/root /sbin/init
</pre>}}

This example needs some device nodes to work, mainly the root block device. Change the script and copy the the corresponding {{Path|/dev/}} node to fit your needs.

Lastly, make the {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} executable:

{{RootCmd|chmod +x /usr/src/initramfs/init}}

=== Packaging Your Initramfs ===

Your ''initramfs'' now has to be made available to your kernel at boot time. This is done by packaging it as a compressed cpio archive. This archive is then either embedded directly into your kernel image, or stored as a separate file which can be loaded by grub during the boot process. Both methods perform equally well, simply choose the method that you find most convenient.

==== Kernel Configuration ====

With either method, you need to enable support for Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support for the ''initramfs'' functionality.

{{Kernel|<nowiki>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y</nowiki>|<pre>
General setup  --->
    [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
</pre>}}

Also enable all drivers, filesystems, and other settings that are required for booting and accessing your root partition. If you select such drivers as modules, you will have to collect and integrate the module files into your ''initramfs'' and load them in your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}. This means a lot of unnecessary extra work, so just use built-in drivers for now.

==== Embedding into the Kernel ====

If you want the ''initramfs'' to be embedded into the kernel image, edit your kernel config and set ''Initramfs source file(s)'' to the root of your ''initramfs'', (e.g {{Path|/usr/src/initramfs}}):

{{Kernel|<nowiki>CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE="/usr/src/initramfs"</nowiki>|<pre>
General setup  --->
    (/usr/src/initramfs) Initramfs source file(s)
</pre>}}

Now when you compile your kernel it will automatically put the files into a cpio archive and embed it into the kernel image. You will need to rebuild your kernel any time you make any changes to your ''initramfs''.

==== Creating a Separate File ====

You can create a standalone archive file by running the following commands:

{{RootCmd
|cd /usr/src/initramfs
|<nowiki>find . -print0 | cpio --null -ov --format=newc | gzip -9 > /boot/my-custom-initramfs.cpio.gz</nowiki>}}

This will create a file called {{Path|my-custom-initramfs.cpio.gz}} in your {{Path|/boot}} directory. You now need to instruct grub to load this file at boot time, you do this with the '''initrd''' line.

{{File|grub.cfg||<pre>
linux 3.12.6-gentoo
initrd my-custom-initramfs.cpio.gz
</pre>}}

{{Note|If you are unfamiliar with bootloader configuration, please refer to [[GRUB2]] or [[GRUB]].}}

=== Finalizing ===

You can now reboot your machine. On boot, the kernel will extract the files from your ''initramfs'' archive automatically and execute your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} script, which in turn should then take care of mounting your root partition and exec the init of your installed Linux distribution.

== Functionality ==

Now that you've covered the ''initramfs'' basics, in this section you will learn how to extend your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} script with more advanced functionality.

=== Rescue Shell ===

If you want to be dropped to a rescue shell if an error occurs, you can add the following function to your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} and call it when something goes wrong.

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init|Rescue Shell|<pre>
rescue_shell() {
    echo "Something went wrong. Dropping you to a shell."
    busybox --install -s
    exec /bin/sh
}
</pre>}}

In the example below, the {{Highlight|rescue_shell}} will be executed if the root partition fails to mount:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
mount -o ro /dev/sda1 /mnt/root || rescue_shell
</pre>}}

=== Dynamic Devices ===

For populating {{Path|/dev}} dynamically, you can use either devtmpfs or mdev. Please note that the kernel can take some time detecting devices (such as external USB drives), so you may also have to add a {{Highlight|sleep}} statement to your script.

==== devtmpfs ====

Provided by the kernel, devtmpfs is designed to offer device nodes early at bootup.

{{Kernel|<nowiki>CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y</nowiki>|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
        [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
</pre>}}

You can include the following snippet in your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} script to have it mount at boot:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
mount -t devtmpfs none /dev
</pre>}}

Don't forget to unmount it again in the cleanup phase of the script:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
umount /dev
</pre>}}

==== mdev ====

Alternatively, you can use mdev, the udev replacement of busybox. For mdev to work, you have to make {{Path|/sbin/mdev}} a symlink to {{Path|/bin/busybox}} in your ''initramfs''.

{{RootCmd|ln -s ../bin/busybox /usr/src/initramfs/sbin/mdev}}

Then add the following snippet to your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}, after mounting {{Path|/proc}} and {{Path|/sys}}:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
echo /sbin/mdev > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
mdev -s
</pre>}}

=== Mount by UUID or LABEL ===

With [[#Dynamic_Devices|Dynamic Devices]] enabled, you might prefer to use UUID or LABEL to mount the root partition instead of using a static device name. For that purpose, Busybox comes with {{Highlight|'''findfs'''}}.

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
mount -o ro $(findfs UUID=845b2454-42a3-19ef-6ec5-238a358c365b) /mnt/root
# or
mount -o ro $(findfs LABEL=myroot) /mnt/root
</pre>}}

Doing it this way is simple, but it means that your UUID or LABEL is hardcoded in {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}. Alternatively, you can also use [[#Kernel_Parameters|Kernel Parameters]].

==== Kernel Parameters ====

If you want to use kernel parameters instead of hardcoding device names or UUIDs, you will have to parse {{Path|/proc/cmdline}}. There are many ways to do so, the following method is just an example to give you the general idea. It uses string manipulation of the shell and only supports <code>key=value</code> parameters. Add the following function to your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} and call it whenever you need a kernel parameter.

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
cmdline() {
    local value
    value=" $(cat /proc/cmdline) "
    value="${value##* $1=}"
    value="${value%% *}"
    [ "$value" != "" ] && echo "$value"
}
</pre>}}

The function is called with the name of the kernel parameter you are interested in. In the example below, it uses the root parameter to mount the root partition.

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
mount -o ro $(findfs $(cmdline root)) /mnt/root
</pre>}}

It works for both <code>root=/dev/sda1</code> and <code>root=UUID=845b2454</code> but fails when the parameter is missing.

=== LVM ===

If your root partition is located on a logical volume, you need to include the LVM binary in your ''initramfs''. You can get a static binary by enabling the '''static''' USE-Flag for {{Package|sys-fs/lvm2}}. Copy it to your ''initramfs'' {{Path|/sbin}} directory.

{{Note|The static LVM binary may also be called {{Path|/sbin/lvm.static}}. Check with {{Highlight|'''ldd'''}} that you're copying a static binary.}}

{{RootCmd|cp -a /sbin/lvm /usr/src/initramfs/sbin/lvm}}

Now you can enable your LVM root partition in {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}. This example assumes that your volume group is called '''VG''', and your root volume is called '''Root'''. Replace them with the names you chose when creating the volume.

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
lvm vgscan --mknodes # creates /dev/mapper/control
lvm lvchange -a ly VG/Root
lvm vgscan --mknodes # creates /dev/mapper/VG-Root and /dev/VG/root
</pre>}}

Your root partition may then be called {{Path|/dev/VG/Root}} or {{Path|/dev/mapper/VG-Root}}.

{{Note|Calling {{Highlight|'''vgscan'''}} is optional, but recommended, just in case device nodes are missing.}}

Recent versions of {{Package|sys-fs/lvm2}} rely on {{Package|sys-fs/udev}} to create the named LV device nodes, but there is no udev in a simple ''initramfs''. You have the following choices:

* use {{Highlight|'''vgscan'''}} as shown above (simplest solution)
* [[#Mount_by_UUID_or_LABEL|Mount by UUID or LABEL]] instead of using {{Path|/dev/VG/Root}}. It works because {{Highlight|'''findfs'''}} is happy with just {{Path|/dev/dm-42}}
* build a LVM binary with the '''-udev''' USE-Flag (specifically for your ''initramfs'' only!)
* disable udev dependency by including a minimal {{Path|/etc/lvm/lvm.conf}} in your ''initramfs'':
  {{File|/usr/src/initramfs/etc/lvm/lvm.conf||<pre>
activation {
    # Set to 0 to disable udev synchronisation (if compiled into the binaries).
    udev_sync = 0
    # Set to 0 to disable the udev rules installed by LVM2
    udev_rules = 0
}
</pre>}}

=== Software RAID ===

Normally the Linux kernel will automatically scan for any "Linux raid autodetect" partitions and start as many software RAIDs as it can find. But if you use an ''initramfs'', the kernel will not automatically scan for RAIDs until it is told to. In the following example instructs the kernel to scan for software RAIDs and start as many as it can find. This will actually start all autodetected arrays, not just {{Path|/dev/md0}}:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
raidautorun /dev/md0
</pre>}}

{{Note|[https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID_superblock_formats#A_Note_about_kernel_autodetection_of_different_superblock_formats "Linux raid autodetect"] won't work for any recent setups, unless you specifically set up your system with partitions of type "fd" and used 0.90 metadata for your Software RAID.}}

==== mdadm ====

If you are not using "Linux raid autodetect" partitions, or need to do more advanced RAID setup, then you can use mdadm instead. You will need to include the mdadm binary in your ''initramfs''. You can get a static binary by enabling the '''static''' USE-Flag for {{Package|sys-fs/mdadm}}.

Copy the binary {{Path|/sbin/mdadm}} and your {{Path|/etc/mdadm.conf}} into your ''initramfs'':

{{RootCmd
|cp -a /sbin/mdadm /usr/src/initramfs/sbin
|cp -a /etc/mdadm.conf /usr/src/initramfs/etc
}}

{{Note|Use mdadm --detail --scan you do not yet have a {{Path|mdadm.conf}}.}}

Edit the {{Path|mdadm.conf}} in your ''initramfs'' to your liking. An example {{Path|mdadm.conf}} follows:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/etc/mdadm.conf||<pre>
DEVICE /dev/sd?*
ARRAY /dev/md0 UUID=627125a5:abce6b82:6c738e49:50adadae
</pre>}}

This {{Path|mdadm.conf}} will scan all {{Path|/dev/sd?*}} devices and assemble the RAID device fitting the UUID 627125a5:abce6b82:6c738e49:50adadae.

{{Note|If your {{Path|mdadm.conf}} has additional conditions such as metadata and name, it may be more practical to remove them. The UUID alone should be sufficient.}}

Now you can initialize your Software RAID in {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
mdadm --assemble --scan
</pre>}}

With this, you should be able to mount your root partition {{Path|/dev/md0}}.

=== DM-Crypt ===

If your root partition is LUKS encrypted, you need to include the cryptsetup binary in your ''initramfs''. You can get a static binary by setting the '''static''' USE-Flag for {{Package|sys-fs/cryptsetup}}. Copy it to your ''initramfs'' {{Path|/sbin}} directory. Since cryptsetup also often requires the use of the kernel's random device, include them as well.

{{RootCmd
|cp -a /dev/{urandom,random} /usr/src/initramfs/dev
|cp -a /sbin/cryptsetup /usr/src/initramfs/sbin/cryptsetup}}

Now you can unlock your encrypted root partition in {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
cryptsetup -T 5 luksOpen /dev/sda1 luksroot
</pre>}}

Once you entered your passphrase, your root partition will be available as {{Path|/dev/mapper/luksroot}}.

==== Encrypted Keyfile ====

If you need encrypted keyfiles, use {{Highlight|cryptsetup}} to encrypt them. It keeps your ''initramfs'' simple as that's the encryption tool you already have - no need to add other binaries. Plus, unlike some of the alternatives, it offers a nice password prompt.

The following example creates a random 512 byte key, encrypted with LUKS, and adds it to your LUKS container {{Path|/dev/sda1}}.

{{Note|Current versions of cryptsetup use 4096 instead of 2056 blocks for LUKS metadata. With the <nowiki>--align-payload=1</nowiki> parameter, it's back to 2056 blocks.
<br />cryptsetup also offers --keyfile-size and --keyfile-offset options. You can use this for keys with other sizes than 512 bytes, or even multiple keys inside the same LUKS container.}}

{{RootCmd
|<nowiki>dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/src/initramfs/root/key.luks count=2057</nowiki>
|<nowiki>cryptsetup --align-payload=1 luksFormat /usr/src/initramfs/root/key.luks</nowiki>
|cryptsetup luksOpen /usr/src/initramfs/root/key.luks lukskey
|<nowiki>dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/mapper/lukskey</nowiki>
|cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda1 /dev/mapper/lukskey}}

Unlocking the root device using this key in your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} can then be done like this:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
# Obtain the key
cryptsetup -T 5 luksOpen /root/key.luks lukskey

# Unlock the root partition
cryptsetup --key-file /dev/mapper/lukskey luksOpen /dev/sda1 luksroot

# Clean up the key
cryptsetup luksClose lukskey
</pre>}}

As before, your root partition should then be available as {{Path|/dev/mapper/luksroot}}.

=== Networking ===

If you need networking in your ''initramfs'', all required network related drivers have to be built into your kernel, and you'll have to configure the network interfaces in your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}}. How exactly this has to be done, depends on your network situation. The following sections cover only the most common cases.

==== Static IP ====

If your network situation allows you to use a static network IP, you can set it up using the {{Highlight|ifconfig}} and {{Highlight|route}} commands, which are included in Busybox. This is by far the easiest solution, so if it's at all possible, go for it.

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
ifconfig eth0 10.0.2.15
route add default gw 10.0.2.2
</pre>}}

==== DHCP ====

To obtain a dynamic IP address from your network's DHCP server, you need a DHCP client. Busybox comes with a minimalistic DHCP client called {{Highlight|udhcpc}}, which is sufficient for most users. Unfortunately, {{Highlight|udhcpc}} has a dependency: it requires the help of a separate script to actually configure the network interface. An example for such a script is included in the Busybox distribution, but it's not installed by Gentoo. You will have to obtain it directly from the Busybox tarball (it's called {{Path|examples/udhcp/simple.script}}) or [http://git.busybox.net/busybox/plain/examples/udhcp/simple.script download it from the Busybox project page].

Copy the script to your ''initramfs'' and make it executable.

{{RootCmd
|cp simple.script /usr/src/initramfs/bin
|chmod +x /usr/src/initramfs/bin/simple.script}}

Edit the script's first line to read {{Highlight|color=darkred|#!/bin/busybox sh}} or create a symlink for {{Path|/bin/sh}}:

{{RootCmd|ln -s busybox /usr/src/initramfs/bin/sh}}

Now, you can obtain a dynamic IP address for eth0 using DHCP:

{{File|/usr/src/initramfs/init||<pre>
ifconfig eth0 up
udhcpc -t 5 -q -s /bin/simple.script
</pre>}}

==== DNS ====

Your network should be up and running now. However, that's only if you know exactly which IPs to talk to. If all you have is a host or domain name, it's a different story entirely. In that case, you need to be able to resolve hostnames. Unfortunately, this is where our luck leaves us. Until now, everything could be done with just the static binary of Busybox - however, this is not the case with DNS.

{{Note|Additional libraries are required to make DNS work.}}

This is because {{Package|sys-libs/glibc}} itself dynamically includes additional libraries for DNS lookups. As long as you don't need that functionality, you're fine, but if you need it, you have no choice but to include those libraries in your ''initramfs''. The only alternative would be building Busybox against another libc such as {{Package|sys-libs/uclibc}}, however that would go beyond the scope of this document.

This is a good chance to demonstrate how to use {{Package|dev-util/strace}} to reveal such hidden dependencies.

{{Cmd|<nowiki>strace busybox ping wiki.gentoo.org 2>&1 | grep open</nowiki>|output=<pre>
open("/etc/nsswitch.conf", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/etc/host.conf", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/etc/resolv.conf", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/lib64/libnss_files.so.2", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/lib64/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/etc/hosts", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC)  = 3
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/lib64/libnss_dns.so.2", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/lib64/libresolv.so.2", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/etc/resolv.conf", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
</pre>}}

As you can see, the command accesses quite a lot of files, some of which are mandatory for it to work.

Copy the necessary libraries to your ''initramfs''.

{{RootCmd|cp /lib64/libnss_{dns,files}.so.2 /lib64/{libresolv,ld-linux-x86-64}.so.2 /lib64/libc.so.6 /usr/src/initramfs/lib64}}

Create a {{Path|/etc/resolv.conf}} with at least one nameserver you can use. Note that this may be done automatically for you if you use [[#DHCP|DHCP]].

{{RootCmd|echo nameserver 10.0.2.3 > /usr/src/initramfs/etc/resolv.conf}}

With this, DNS lookups should now work for you.

== Troubleshooting ==

The following section tries to provide help with common issues and pitfalls you may run into.

=== Static vs. Dynamic binaries ===

Any custom binaries you need to use in your ''initramfs'' before mounting have to be fully functional, independently from any files you may have installed on your root partition. This is much easier to achieve with static binaries (which usually work as single file) than with dynamic binaries (which need any number of additional libraries to work).

Gentoo provides static binaries for some ebuilds. Check if the ebuild for your binary offers a '''static''' or '''-dynamic''' USE flag. That's by far the easiest method to get a static binary for something, but unfortunately only a select few ebuilds support it.

Many applications also offer static builds with an option in their configure scripts. There is no standard name for the option, it may be --enable-static or similar. When compiling a package manually, check the list of available options with ./configure --help to see if it supports building static binaries for you.

You can check whether or not a binary is static by using the {{Highlight|'''ldd'''}} command. The {{Highlight|'''strace'''}} command is also very useful to find out about additional dependencies. With {{Highlight|'''equery files'''}} you can see which files a certain package brought into your system, some of which may also be candidates for additional dependencies of that package.

{{Note|
* See [[#Applications|Applications]] for a {{Highlight|'''ldd'''}} usage example.
* See [[#DNS|DNS]] for a {{Highlight|'''strace'''}} usage example.}}

Including libraries into your ''initramfs'' in order to make a dynamic executable work is a last resort only. It makes the ''initramfs'' much larger and more complicated to maintain than necessary. It also makes the ''initramfs'' harder to maintain, as the dependencies might change with every update of the program in question.

=== Kernel panics ===

When working with ''initramfs'' and writing custom init scripts for it, you may experience the following kernel panic on boot:

 Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!

This is not an error in the kernel, but an error in your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} script. This script is executed as the init process with PID 1. Unlike other processes, the PID 1 init process is special. It is the only process that is started by the kernel on boot. It's the process that takes care of starting other processes (boot process, init scripts) which in turn start other processes (daemons, login prompts, X), which in turn start other processes (bash, window manager, browser, ...). The init process is the mother of all other processes, and therefore it mustn't be killed. On shutdown, it's again the init process that takes care of cleaning up by shutting down other processes first, then running processes that will unmount the filesystems, until it is safe to actually do a shutdown without corrupting anything.

If you have some error in your {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} script, that causes the init process to end, this basically means there are no processes left to run, there is nothing that could take care of cleaning up, and the kernel has no choice but to panic. For this reason there are some things in {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} that you can't do like you can do them in a normal shell script, like using return or exit, or letting the script just run a series of commands and then simply end.

If you want {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} to end, you have to pass the responsibility of the init process to someone else using '''exec'''. See the examples above how '''exec''' is used to either run /sbin/init of the mounted root partition or to run a rescue shell in case something went wrong.

=== Job Control ===

While working with ''initramfs'', especially the [[#Rescue_Shell|Rescue Shell]], you may come across this message:

 /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off

The lack of Job Control is usually not a problem, since {{Highlight|color=darkgreen|'''/init'''}} is not supposed to be interactive. However, if you want to work with the Busybox shell on a regular basis, being unable to control programs with {{Key|Ctrl-C}} or {{Key|Ctrl-Z}} can easily become a huge issue. In worst case, if Job Control is not available, and a program refuses to quit, you have to reboot.

The [http://www.busybox.net/FAQ.html#job_control busybox FAQ] offers some help here. You can either use

{{RootCmd|setsid sh -c 'exec sh </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1'}}

or

{{RootCmd|setsid cttyhack sh}}

to start a shell on tty1 with jobcontrol enabled.

=== Salvaging ===

If for whatever reason you lost your {{Path|/usr/src/initramfs}} structure, but you still got either the kernel image with the built-in ''initramfs'', or the separate cpio archive, it's possible to salvage it from there. Although it may be easier to just redo it from scratch - if you've done it once, doing it again should be a piece of cake. So this is just in case.

==== Dismantling the Kernel ====

You can skip this step if your ''initramfs'' is a separate cpio archive already. Otherwise, you'll have to get the built-in cpio archive out of the kernel image. To do that, you have to dismantle it, which isn't easy, since the kernel image is a combination of boot sector and compressed archive itself. It also depends on the compression you are using for your kernel and for your ''initramfs''. For simplicity, this example assumes bzip2 - however, the principle is the same for other compression methods.

The utility of choice when dismantling kernel images is {{Package|app-misc/binwalk}}. In analyzes arbitrary files for known signatures, and prints their offsets. While there are usually a bunch of false matches in the output, it should be easy to pick the correct ones.

{{Cmd|binwalk bzImage|output=<pre>
DECIMAL     HEX         DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15949       0x3E4D      bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
3042172     0x2E6B7C    LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x9A, dictionary size: 4194304 bytes, uncompressed size: 9439488 bytes
4433597     0x43A6BD    LZMA compressed data, properties: 0xD8, dictionary size: 16777216 bytes, uncompressed size: 4213785 bytes
8530175     0x8228FF    ELF (NetBSD)
</pre>}}

A less sophisticated method would be to grep for signatures. For bzip2, this is '''BZh'''. For gzip, you can use '''<nowiki>$'\x1f'$'\x8b'</nowiki>'''.

{{Cmd|grep -a -b --only-matching BZh bzImage|output=<pre>
15949:BZh
3946909:BZh
</pre>}}

In this case the offset we are looking for is '''15949''' bytes. Now you can extract the compressed kernel image:

{{Cmd|<nowiki>dd if=bzImage bs=15949 skip=1 | bunzip2 > Image</nowiki>}}

Now, you have the uncompressed kernel image. Somewhere within this image resides the compressed ''initramfs'' archive, so just iterate the previous process to find it. Depending on your kernel configuration, you're looking for another bzip2, gzip, or cpio container.

{{Cmd
|binwalk Image
|grep -a -b --only-matching BZh Image}}

Suppose the offset is 171424 bytes this time. Now you can extract the ''initramfs'' cpio archive:

{{Cmd|<nowiki>dd if=Image bs=171424 skip=1 | bunzip2 > initramfs.cpio</nowiki>}}

If you want to verify that you actually got a cpio archive from that, use file:

{{Cmd|file initramfs.cpio|output=<pre>
initramfs.cpio: ASCII cpio archive (SVR4 with no CRC)
</pre>}}

==== Extracting the cpio archive ====

If your ''initramfs'' cpio archive was a separate file, you have to uncompress it first.

{{Cmd|gunzip initramfs.cpio.gz}}

To extract the uncompressed {{Path|initramfs.cpio}}, you can do so with the following command:

{{Warning|This will overwrite files in your current directory. Do it in {{Path|/tmp/initramfs/}} or similar.}}

{{Cmd|cpio -i -d -H newc --no-absolute-filenames < initramfs.cpio}}

With this, you should have successfully recovered your ''initramfs'' structure.

=== Integrated initramfs doesn't always update ===

If your ''initramfs'' is integrated into your kernel (instead of using a separate file), there's a possibility that a {{Highlight|make bzImage}} does not actually update it every time. So you might be making changes to your ''initramfs'' but actually keep booting using your old, buggy one. In this case you have to manually delete the integrated image to force the kernel to integrate a fresh ''initramfs'' archive:

{{RootCmd|rm /usr/src/linux/usr/initramfs_data.cpio*}}

Alternatively, you could also {{Highlight|make clean}}, but then the entire kernel will need to be recompiled.
