===General Configuration===
TODO

===Hard Disks and DVD Drives===
The hard disk controller should work with the standard AHCI driver:
{{Kernel|ACHI Driver|<pre>
Device Drivers --->
    [*] Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers  --->
        <*> AHCI SATA Support
</pre>}}
Make sure that AHCI support is compiled into the kernel, and not as a module, or the kernel may fail to boot.

===Memory Card Reader===
The memory card reader should work fine with the standard driver:
{{Kernel|Card Reader Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] MMC/SD/SDIO card support  --->
        <*> Secure Digital Host Controller Interface support
        <*> SDHCI support on PCI bus
</pre>}}

===Video Chipset===
The video chipset is an nVidia GeForce 9600M GS, which has full support for 2D/3D acceleration, CUDA, and OpenCL with the proprietary drivers.
At the time of this writing, the open source drivers provide 2D acceleration and partial 3D support.
See [[nVidia Graphics]] for details on video card support and driver selection.

===Input Devices===
The keyboard support for X11 is provided by evdev.
Touchpad support is provided through synaptics.
{{File|/etc/make.conf|Input Device Support|
INPUT_DEVICES&#x3d;"evdev synaptics"
}}
The media buttons on the touchpad are not supported, but normal touchpad and scrollwheel functionality works perfectly.

===Ethernet===
Networking is provided by a Realtek 8168B Gigabit Ethernet device.
{{Kernel|Firewire Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  --->  
        [*] Ethernet (1000 Mbit)  --->
            <*> Realtek 8169 gigabit ethernet support
</pre>}}

===802.11 Wifi===
Wifi is provided by an Atheros AR928X wifi adapter:
{{Kernel|Firewire Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Network device support  --->  
        [*] Wireless LAN  --->
            <M> Atheros Wireless Cards  --->
                <M> Atheros 802.11n wireless cards support
</pre>}}

===Sound===
The audio hardware is supported by the Intel HD Audio drivers:
{{Kernel|Firewire Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Sound card support  --->
        <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
            <*> Sequencer support 
            <*> OSS Mixer API
            <*> OSS PCM (digital audio) API
            [*] OSS PCM (digital audio) API - Include plugin system
            [*] OSS Sequencer API
            <*> HR-timer backend support
                [*] Use HR-timer as default sequencer timer
            [*] PCI sound devices  --->
                <*> Intel HD Audio
</pre>}}

===USB===
USB support is provided by the standard drivers:
{{Kernel|Firewire Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
        <*> Support for Host-side USB
        <*> EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support
        <*> UHCI HCD support (most Intel and VIA) support
</pre>}}

===Firewire===
The Firewire port should work fine with the standard driver:
{{Kernel|Firewire Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    IEEE 1394 (FireWire) support  --->  
        <*> FireWire driver stack
        <*> OHCI-1394 controllers
</pre>}}
At the time of this writing, the author has not tested Firewire.

===Bluetooth===
TODO

===Webcam===
The built-in webcam is a is supported through V4L with USB2.0 UVC:
{{Kernel|Webcam Support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Multimedia support  --->
        <*> Video For Linux   
        [*] Video capture adapters  ---> 
            [*] V4L USB devices  --->
                <*> USB Video Class (UVC) 
</pre>}}

===Fingerprint Reader===
The fingerprint reader should be supported through USB and libfprint. See [[Fingerprint Reader]].

===ASUS Extras===
