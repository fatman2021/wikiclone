'''eselect''' is a tool for administration and configuration on Gentoo systems. It ''will'' modify the system’s behaviour and should be used with care by the system administrator. eselect is a modular framework for writing configuration utilities. It consists of:

* A main program called <code>eselect</code>.
* Various modules (<code>*.eselect</code> files) which carry out different tasks.
* Several libraries which help ensure consistent behaviour and simplify the creation of new modules.

A module provides several actions. Actions typically either display some information (<code>list</code> and <code>show</code> actions are common) or update the system somehow (for example, <code>set</code> and <code>update</code>). Each module also provides <code>help</code> and <code>usage</code> actions which explain how to use the module.
