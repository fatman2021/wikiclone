This article describes the setup of scripts in {{Path|/etc/local.d/}} which get executed once during boot or shutdown.
== A Word of Caution ==
{{Warning|
Any scripts in {{Path|/etc/local.d/}} are meant to execute a few commands (e.g. write some value to some file in {{Path|/proc/}}) and terminate.}}
It is a bad idea to abuse this infrastructure to start any other scripts/programs in the background because:
* if the {{Path|/etc/init.d/local}} service script is restarted several times, those scripts/programs will be executed in the background several times, possibly resulting in race conditions
* a *.stop script for terminating those processes would have to be also present and may easily fail when e.g. the *.start script has been executed several times
For these reasons, it is a lot more convenient to write a real OpenRC initscript file as described in the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=2&chap=4 OpenRC Initscripts chapter of the Gentoo Handbook].

== Configuration ==
All scripts in {{Path|/etc/local.d/}} with the suffix ''.start'' will be executed at boot time, all scripts with suffix ''.stop'' at shutdown time.

To e.g. output the text ''Hello world!'' at boot time, create the new file {{Path|/etc/local.d/HelloWorld.start}}:
{{File|/etc/local.d/HelloWorld.start||<pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello world!"
</pre>}}
Afterwards mark the script as executable: 
{{RootCmd|chmod +x /etc/local.d/HelloWorld.start}}

To start the local.d scripts at boot time, add its init.d script to your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add local}}
Now you can start the service by making OpenRC check for stopped services in the default runlevel
{{RootCmd|rc}}
or start it explicitly
{{RootCmd|rc-service local start}}
