To install a desktop environment such as GNOME3 requires the use of systemd but the present [https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook]  is based on the use of Openrc. It just indicates that changes have to be made when using systemd but never tells the user where the changes occur. 
As for the systemd page, it mainly concentrate on an update starting from an existing system. Thus, it can be a kind of challenge, specially for a new comer to Gentoo, to install a GNOME3 desktop from scratch.
The purpose of this page is to indicate where changes have to be made to the current [https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook]  to do so.
The indications given refer mainly to an amd64 install.
== Base System Installation ==
Hereafter are the modifications to bring to the [https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook] for an amd64 platform.
=== Part 1 to 5 of the handbook ===
No change here.

==== Updating the system ====
As the choice of desktop/gnome/systemd implies a lot of changes in the packages to be installed, you are advised to make a full update before going on:

{{Emerge| emerge --update --deep --newuse @world}}

===  Configuring the kernel ===
Do not emerge genkernel here but genkernel-next instead.
{{RootCmd|emerge genkernel-next}}

If you plan to include support for your graphic card and in case this graphic card requires proprietary binary blobs, emerge linux-firmware otherwise kernel will not compile.
{{RootCmd|emerge linux-firmware }}

May not be necessary at this stage but doesn't harm, add VIDEO_CARDs="<your card type>" in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.

Use option ''menuconfig'' with genkernel
{{RootCmd|genkernel  --menuconfig all}}
Select the systemd init system without disabling Openrc

{{Kernel|Quick setup using gentoo-sources|<pre>
Gentoo Linux --->
        Support for init systems, system and service managers --->
                [*]Openrc 
                [*] systemd
</pre>}}

Include settings for your graphic card referring to the ad hoc page on this wiki, most currently [[radeon]] and [[NVidia/nvidia-drivers]].

Create the symlink for {{Path|/etc/mtab}} (see [[Systemd#/etc/mtab|this]] for details)
{{RootCmd|ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab}}

=== Configuring your system ===
==== Defining your keyboard ====
With systemd, setting keyboard=fr into {{Path|etc/conf.d/keymaps}} will be effectless. Instead, you should set this into {{Path|/etc/vconsole.conf}}.
The various keymaps are  stored into subdirectories of {{Path|/usr/share/keymaps/}} and can be listed with the following command
{{RootCmd| localectl list-keymaps}}

{{Note| If you intend to use a very specific keymap (such as the French bepo typematrix keymap) that is not listed here, get it by any way at your disposal in the form of a .gz file, store it on a drive accessible to the system, mount this drive and copy it into on of the subdirectories of  {{Path|/usr/share/keymaps/}}. Then run the previous command again to make sure it is available.}}

Once you have you keymap listed, select it with the following command, replacing fr-dvorak-bepo with your own keymap  :
{{RootCmd| localectl set-keymap --no-convert fr-dvorak-bepo}}

Doubble check with 
{{RootCmd|cat /etc/vconsole.conf}}

=== Installing Necessary system Tools ===
==== System Logger ====
{{Note| syslog-ng or sysloggd are no longer necessary as [[Systemd]] comes with its own journal thus you can skip this section completely. Please, have also a look at the man page of '''journalctl''' or at this [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd#Journal more readable page] on the Arch Linux wiki (and its subsequents links) to know more about the '''journalctl''' command that allows you  to read the entries of this journal. Nevertheless, the previous loggers can still be used in conjonction with systemd.}}

 
syslog-ng conflicts with systemd[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Systemd#syslog-ng_conflicts_with_systemd] systemd creates {{Path|/dev/log}} as datagram socket [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=770810#c10] [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F16_bugs#systemd-syslog-ng-problems] so you will need to tell syslog-ng to read from a ''unix-dgram'' instead of a ''unix-stream'' if you are hitting problems and are using "wrong" stream:
{{File|/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf||<pre>
unix-stream('/dev/log');
</pre>}}
should be replaced with:
{{File|/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf||<pre>
unix-dgram('/dev/log');
</pre>}} in order to use the syslog-ng service in systemd.
To enable syslog-ng use the following command :
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable syslog-ng}}
To disable it, use :
{{RootCmd| systemctl disable syslog-ng}}

==== Networking tools ====
dhcpcd will not be started at boot unless you enable dhcpcd.service with systemd.
Refer to the [[Systemd| systemd]] page to know how to do it before rebooting.
Otherwise you will be able to do so after boot with 
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable dhcpcd.service}}
{{RootCmd|systemctl start dhcpcd.service}}
==== Installing systemd itself ====
{{Note| If you did the full update as advised before, systemd should already be installed.}}

{{RootCmd|emerge sys-apps/systemd}}
{{Note|You don't have to add systemd flag to {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} as it is already set into the chosen profile.}}

=== Configuring the Bootloader ===
After emerging {{Package|sys-boot/grub}}, edit '''{{Path|/etc/default/grub}}'''  and add the following line (if using ext4 for root partition)
{{File|/etc/default/grub|Example grub2-mkconfig config for systemd|<pre>
# Append parameters to the linux kernel command line
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootfstype=ext4 real_init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd"</pre>
}}
Then run:
{{RootCmd|mkdir /boot/grub}}
{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg}}

===Finalizing your Gentoo Installation ===
It may be necessary to enable and start dcpcd.service and to use systemd to define keyboard layout (see the systemd page).

== X server Installation ==

=== Install x11-base/xorg-drivers ===


==== /etc/portage/make.conf ====
Don't forget to add the following lines to the {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} file:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
VIDEO_CARDS="radeon"
</pre>}}
{{Note|Replace radeon according to your card brand}}

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
INPUT_DEVICES ="evdev"
</pre>}}

Then emerge the drivers:
{{Emerge|emerge x11-base/xorg-drivers}}

==== Kernel settings ====
Follow the page X server to set the kernel paramaters for evdev and  the kernel parameters for your graphic card if not already done. Recompile the kernel
=== Check startx ===
In order to check the x server install xterm and twm
{{Emerge| xterm twm }}
Then use the following command:
{{RootCmd|startx}}
If everything is correct you should see a graphic page with some terminals inside. Quit with {{Key|Ctrl}}-{{Key|Alt}}-{{Key|Del}} and unmerge xterm and twm.

== Gnome3 Installation ==
You are now ready to install GNOME 3:
{{emerge|gnome}}

{{Note|In my case, to solve a conflict between to versions of openssl one using the ''bindist'' USE flag and the other using the ''-bindist'' use flag, I had to add the ''-bindist'' USE flag to Openssh in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} and re-emerge it with --newuse flag before installing gnome.}}
In order to have the Gnome Display Manager after boot, enable it:
{{RootCmd| systemctl enable gdm.service}}

Reboot and enjoy Gnome3 !
