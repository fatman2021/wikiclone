{{Package|sys-apps/portage}} is Gentoo's [[Wikipedia:Package management system|package manager]], and is installed by default as part of the stage3 install. See the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/ Gentoo Handbook] for more details.

== Overlays ==
In addition to the official repository (colloquially known as "portage tree" because of its traditional placement in {{Path|/usr/portage/}}), there are additional repositories which in Gentoo are called [[overlay]]s.

* [http://layman.sourceforge.net/ Layman homepage]
* [http://gpo.zugaina.org/ Browse overlays]

You can search through the ebuilds available in the overlays on http://overlays.gentoo.org/ by using [[eix]].

== Command-line interface: emerge ==
'''emerge''' is the command-line interface to the Portage system. This is how most users will interact with portage. <code>emerge</code> with lots of options. For a complete list see its man page:

{{Cmd|man emerge}}

Below you see an exemplary invocation of <code>emerge</code>. The options (<code>-atv</code>) are shortcuts for <code>--ask</code>, <code>--tree</code> and <code>--verbose</code>. They trigger <code>emerge</code> to ask before proceeding, display the dependency tree and to be verbose. <code>package</code> is a so called [[atom]] and refers to a portage package.
