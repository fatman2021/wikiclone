[[Mount]]ing removable media, like CDs, DVDs, USB drives or memory cards, needs special handling, because most often you want a regular user to be able to mount ad-hoc an unknown device.

== Prerequisites ==
* Kernel support for your [[:Category:Storage devices|storage device]].
* Kernel support for your [[filesystem]].

== udisks ==
[[udisks]] is a daemon to manage mounting of removable media. It mounts filesystems to subfolders of {{Path|/media}}.

=== KDE ===
[[KDE]] supports udisks with its Solid framework. After plugging in the media shows up:
* in the '''device notifier''' widget
* in the start menu under '''Computer -> Places'''
* in Dolphin in the sidebar under '''Places'''

* [[mount]] - Manual mount.
* [[fstab]] - Automatic mount at boot time.
* [[AutoFS]] - Automatic mount on access.
