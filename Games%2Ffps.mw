Alien Arena is a fast paced multiplayer deathmatch game similar to ''Quake'' and ''Unreal Tournament'', but with a deep sci-fi atmosphere, lot's of shiny and weird graphics and... aliens. The engine is based on the CXR game engine, but has been rewritten to allow a lot of new features and improvements such as 32bit high-resolution textures. The physics is based on the Quake II physics, but also allows dodging. It also features single-player matches against bots.

The true legend. Quake III Arena is a multiplayer shooter focussing on competitive matches, be it duel, capture the flag, instagib, deathmatch,... It has defined modern tournament shooters and still has an active community. The portage version uses the ioquake3 engine which is kind of a fork based on the source code release of the original Quake III in 2005. There are tons of mods and extension packs available in portage (such as {{Package|games-fps/quake3-matrix}} or {{Package|games-fps/quake3-nsco}}), as well as a data ebuild ({{Package|games-fps/quake3-data}}) and a demo ebuild ({{Package|games-fps/quake3-demo}}).

Urban Terror is is an open-source multiplayer first person shooter based on the ioquake3 engine. It can be described as a hollywood tactical shooter; somewhat realism based, but the motto is "fun over realism". This results in a very unique, enjoyable and addictive game which reminds of ''Counter Strike'', but is more action and speed oriented.
