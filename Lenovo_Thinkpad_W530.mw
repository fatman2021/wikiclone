The Lenovo Thinkpad W530 and its associated hardware components can be difficult to configure properly in Gentoo. This article is a configuration guide to help you work out some of the details in order to get your notebook working as it should be. Do not expect to have exactly the same hardware listed in this guide in your W530. The hardware listed here is to be used as an example. Some of the components might be similar, but there are always variants in computer manufacturing. 

== General Platform Notes ==

=== Important Tools ===
These tools will help you diagnose problems if you learn how to use them properly. They are included on SystemRescueCD, which is the distribution this author recommends when installing Gentoo. Be sure to emerge them on your system after the install is complete for future troubleshooting.

==== Software Tools ====
===== eix =====
{{Package|app-portage/eix}}: A faster and better way to search for packages. Searching with <code>emerge --search</code> is very close compared to searching using the <code>eix <package name> </code> command.

===== ufed =====
{{Package|app-portage/ufed}}: A simple program designed to help you configure the systems USE flags to your liking. Start the program from the terminal by typing the <code>ufed</code> command. Search for the use flag desired by pressing <code>/</code> once and then typing the flag's name. Close the program by pressing <code>ctrl+c</code> on the keyboard.

==== Hardware Detection Tools ====
===== pciutils =====
{{Package|sys-apps/pciutils}}: Includes important command line tools for identifying hardware such as <code>lspci</code>.

===== gentookit =====
{{Package|gentoolkit}}: Includes other command line tools for identifying system hardware such as <code>lsusb</code>.

===== More tools =====
For more hardware detection tools see the [[Hardware_detection| hardware detection]] article.

=== Compiler Speed Enhancements ===
==== Caching Portage in tmpfs ====
If you are using an SSD or HHD and you have a lot of RAM (16GB would be more than enough) you can both expand the life of your drive and speed up build time by caching your Portage temp directory completely in RAM. Be sure to adjust to the amount of memory you want to allocate. The example below allows Portage to use maximum of 10GBs of RAM (tmpfs) during compiles. You can read more about caching Portage in tmpfs by reading [[Portage_TMPDIR_on_tmpfs|this article]].
{{file|/etc/fstab|Adding Portage temp directory to 10GBs of tmpfs:|
<pre>
tmpfs		/var/tmp/portage	tmpfs	uid=portage,gid=portage,mode=0775,size=10240M,noatime	0 0
</pre>
}}

After {{path|/etc/fstab}} has been modified, Portage's temp directory will be mounted in RAM on every boot. To mount Portage temp directory now simply run this command:
{{RootCmd|mount /var/tmp/portage}}

== Kernel Configuration ==

=== Manual Configuration ===
In order to build your kernel properly use the <code>make menuconfig</code> command to start configure your kernel:
{{RootCmd|make menuconfig|}}

After configuration run these commands in this order to build and install your system's kernel and modules:
{{RootCmd|make|}}
{{RootCmd|make modules|}}
{{RootCmd|make install|}}
{{RootCmd|make modules_install|}}

=== Genkernel ===
You can also use the <code>genkernel</code> tool to configure your kernel:
{{RootCmd|genkernel --install --menuconfig all}}

== System Hardware ==

{{Important|As stated above, the hardware listed in the following commands might not match the hardware in your system verbatim.}}
