'''CTAPI''' is a german standard for PC to smartcard reader communication, which is implemented by OpenCT. The international standard is in contrast [[PCSC-Lite|PC/SC]].

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You have to enable kernel support depending on how your cardreader is connected:
* For USB cardreader see the [[USB]] article.
* For PC-Card cardreader see the [[PC-Card]] article.
* For serial cardreader enable serial support.

=== Software ===
Portage knows the local USE flag ''openct'' for enabling support for OpenCT in other packages. Enabling this USE flag will pull in {{Package|dev-libs/openct}} automatically:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|1=
USE="... openct ..."
}}
The USE flags of openct are:
{{USEflag|package=dev-libs/openct
|debug
|doc
|pcsc-lite
|udev+yes
|usb+yes
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
Add your user to the ''openct'' group to be able to access the cardreader:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a larry openct}}

=== Service ===
You can now start OpenCT:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/openct start}}
To start OpenCT at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add openct default}}

{{Note|The OpenCT daemon blocks all detected cardreaders for every other software. An exception is, if you use the ifdhandler for PCSC-Lite.}}

== Testing ==
List all detected cardreaders:
{{Cmd|openct-tool list}}

If there is a detected cardreader, insert a smartcard. Test the access by checking the [[Wikipedia:Answer to reset|ATR]]:
{{Cmd|openct-tool atr|output=<pre>
Detected CCID Compatible
Card present, status changed
ATR: 3B 75 94 00 00 62 02 02 03 01
</pre>}}
