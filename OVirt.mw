'''oVirt''' is a complete open sourced virtualization management platform working with [[QEMU|KVM]]. The project is made of:
* The '''Engine core''', which is the backend server that does the management. 
* The various '''VDSM agents''' installed on each host you 'll use as a hypervisor for VMs
* A '''client side UI''' (GWT based) and/or '''RESTful API''' to control the engine core.

== Description ==

* A [[PostgreSQL]] server
* The engine core and UI

* For the VDSM agents
** (Work in progress)

== PostgreSQL ==

* Emerge PostgreSQL server.
{{emerge|{{package|dev-db/postgresql-server}}}}
* Configure PostgresSQL server
{{RootCmd|emerge --config {{package|dev-db/postgresql-server}}}}
* Allow network access

Modify:
{{File|/etc/postgres-*/pg_hba.conf||<pre>
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            password
host    all             all             ::1/128                 password
</pre>}}

* Start
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/postgres* start}}

* Create user and database
{{RootCmd|su - postgres -c "psql -d template1"|output=<pre>
template1=# create user engine password 'engine';
template1=# drop database engine;
template1=# create database engine owner engine;
</pre>}}

== oVirt Engine ==

* Add oVirt overlay to /etc/portage/make.conf

Portage overlay exists here: http://github.com/alonbl/ovirt-overlay

* Emerge ovirt-engine
{{emerge|app-emulation/ovirt-engine}}
{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/ovirt-engin|
system-jars+yes+yes+use system jars as match as possible instead maven fetched ones|
minimal+no+no+build only firefox support, faster build}}

{{Note|<nowiki>Before reporting any issue, please try to build with USE="-system-jars".</nowiki>}}

You may need to add unstable keywords to various packages.

* Configure ovirt-engine
{{RootCmd|emerge --config app-emulation/ovirt-engine}}

Follow instructions.

== Configure Apache ==

* Add, after APACHE2_OPTS="XXX"
{{File|/etc/conf.d/apache2||<pre>
APACHE2_OPTS="${APACHE2_OPTS} -D PROXY"
</pre>}}
* Restart
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/apache2 restart}}

=== Testing ===

Login into http://localhost/ovirt-engine

Logs are at /var/log/ovirt-engine

== Install vdsm ==
{{Warning|VDSM for now is mostly Fedora/Redhat oriented, trying to set up VDSM on a non-Fedora node takes more than you think. If you succeed however please update this part of the article and notify upstream. Until then I suggest you use an oVirt-node image for your Hypervisors from here [http://ovirt.org/releases/stable/binary/]}}
* Install dev-python/pyflakes as it is needed by vdsm
{{Emerge|dev-python/pyflakes}}
* Obtain VDSM source RPM
{{Cmd|wget -c http://fsimonce.fedorapeople.org/vdsm/fedora-16/SRPMS/vdsm-4.9.0-0.200.g2fc4e63.fc16.src.rpm}}
* Convert rpm package to tgz
{{Cmd|rpm2tgz vdsm-4.9.0-0.200.g2fc4e63.fc16.src.rpm}}
* Unpack the archive
{{Cmd|tar zxvf vdsm-4.9.0-0.200.g2fc4e63.fc16.src.tgz}}
* Enter the directory and do the configure-make-make install magic (Recommended to use –prefix when compiling from source so you can have all files under one directory per package)
{{RootCmd|cd vdsm-4.9.0-0.200.g2fc4e63.fc16}}
{{RootCmd|./configure --prefix{{=}}/path/to/install/directory && make && make install}}

== How to contribute ==
* oVirt project is working with Gerrit code review for code contribution.
* In order to register and login to oVirt's Gerrit, you'll need an OpenID account.
** You can use a Google OpenID, or register to some other provider and use it,
* All other details can be found here: http://www.ovirt.org/wiki/Working_with_oVirt_Gerrit

== Advanced features ==

=== oVirt Node integration ===
* By default development setup works with hosts based on base distro's installations.
* In order to be able to work with oVirt Node (which is a sub-set of the base OS), you'll need to setup a Public Key environment.
* More details on Engine and oVirt Node integration can be found here: http://www.ovirt.org/wiki/Engine_Node_Integration.
** Note that by default Gentoo does not have /etc/pki folder, and you'll need to create it (or write an eBuild which will do that).

=== Troubleshooting JBoss (obsolete) ===
If you're being attacked by exceptions, follow this list:
* Verify jboss folder owner and permissions.
* If your machine has and selinux policy installed, make sure it will not block JBoss. Here is a very dirty and insecure jboss.te just to temporarily pass these denials (you'll also need selinux-java)
{{Code|jboss.te|<pre>module jboss 1.0;

require {
        type user_tmp_t;
        type user_home_dir_t;
        type bin_t;
        type usr_t;
        type port_t;
        type node_t;
        type sysfs_t;
        type newrole_t;
        type java_t;
        class tcp_socket { name_bind listen accept node_bind };
        class fd use;
        class capability dac_override;
        class file{ read write getattr open create unlink };
        class dir { getattr read write open search add_name create remove_name };
}

#============= java_t ==============
allow java_t newrole_t:fd use;
allow java_t bin_t:file { getattr read open };
allow java_t self:capability dac_override;
allow java_t sysfs_t:dir { read search open };
allow java_t user_tmp_t:dir { read getattr open search write add_name create remove_name };
allow java_t user_home_dir_t:dir search;
allow java_t user_tmp_t:file { create read write open unlink };
allow java_t usr_t:dir { write add_name create remove_name };
allow java_t usr_t:file { create open write };
allow java_t port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;
allow java_t self:tcp_socket { listen accept };
allow java_t node_t:tcp_socket node_bind;
</pre>}}

* Used TCP ports: 8702/8083/1090/4457
** Since JBoss binds to the hostname, your hostname should be resolvable, or you may add it to /etc/hosts for local resolution.
 127.0.0.1 localhost engine-dev
