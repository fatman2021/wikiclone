This article describes a simple automated backup scheme using the tool '''rsnapshot''', which is based on [[Wikipedia:Rsync|rsync]]. rsnapshot makes a specified number of incremental backups of specified file trees, using [[Wikipedia:Hard link|hard links]] to save space on the backup medium.

== Setup ==

=== Installation ===
Install {{Package|app-backup/rsnapshot}}:
{{Emerge|rsnapshot}}

=== fstab ===
Add an entry like the following in your [[fstab]]:
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
LABEL=backup    /mnt/backup    ext4    noatime,noauto    0 0
</pre>}}
In this example, the filesystem is [[ext4]], identified by the label ''backup'', and attaches to a special mount point {{Path|/mnt/backup}}. The ''noauto'' option means that this backup filesystem will not be mounted by default.  The backup filesystem would normally be on an external disk.

=== Cron scripts ===
Create [[cron]] scripts for the different backup intervals:
{{File|/etc/cron.daily/rsnapshot.daily||<pre>
#!/bin/sh

echo "### RSNAPSHOT DAILY ###"
mount /mnt/backup && rsnapshot -c /etc/rsnapshot.d/daily.conf daily || echo "Backup failure"
umount /mnt/backup
echo
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/cron.weekly/rsnapshot.weekly||<pre>
#!/bin/sh

echo "### RSNAPSHOT WEEKLY ###"
mount /mnt/backup && rsnapshot -c /etc/rsnapshot.d/weekly.conf weekly || echo "Backup failure"
umount /mnt/backup
echo
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/cron.monthly/rsnapshot.monthly||<pre>
#!/bin/sh

echo "### RSNAPSHOT MONTHLY ###"
mount /mnt/backup && rsnapshot -c /etc/rsnapshot.d/monthly.conf monthly || echo "Backup failure"
umount /mnt/backup
echo
</pre>}}
{{Note|These scripts must be executable.}}

=== rsnapshot configuration files ===
Set up the rsnapshot configuration files referred to in the scripts above.  
{{Note|rsnapshot configuration files are '''tab delimited'''. Be careful to always use tabs instead of spaces for the options.}}
{{Note|Filetree specifications are in ''rsync'' format.  See the ''rsync'' [[man page]] for details.}}
First a base configuration:
{{File|/etc/rsnapshot.d/base.conf||<pre>
# Default config version
config_version	1.2

# So the hard disk is not polluted in case the backup filesystem is not available
no_create_root	1

# Standard settings
cmd_cp			/bin/cp
cmd_rm			/bin/rm
cmd_rsync		/usr/bin/rsync
link_dest		1

# For convenience, so that mount points can be taken as backup starting points
one_fs			1

# Store all backups in one directory per machine
# A useful alternative may be to create a separate directory for each interval
snapshot_root   /mnt/backup/
</pre>}}

Then, here are sample configuration files for daily, weekly and monthly backups:
{{File|/etc/rsnapshot.d/daily.conf||<pre>
include_conf   /etc/rsnapshot.d/base.conf

# Daily (30 increments)
retain	daily	30
backup		/home/me/		localhost/
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/rsnapshot.d/weekly.conf||<pre>
include_conf   /etc/rsnapshot.d/base.conf

# Weekly (12 increments)
retain	weekly	12
backup		/etc/			localhost/
backup		/var/db/pkg/world	localhost/
backup		/boot/			localhost/
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/rsnapshot.d/monthly.conf||<pre>
include_conf   /etc/rsnapshot.d/base.conf

# Monthly (6 increments)
retain	monthly	6
exclude		/home/me/
exclude		/tmp/**
exclude		/usr/portage/distfiles/**
exclude		/boot/
exclude		/home/scratch/**
exclude		/var/tmp/ccache/**
backup		/			localhost/
</pre>}}

In these files, the second argument of ''backup'' specifies a container directory for the backups, usually referring to the machine (in this case, ''localhost'').  This can be changed to any name of your choosing.

== Restoration ==
To restore the ''localhost'' backups specified above, we would use
{{RootCmd|mount /mnt/backup
|rsync -a /mnt/backup/localhost/monthly.0/ /mnt/myroot/
|rsync -a /mnt/backup/localhost/weekly.0/ /mnt/myroot/
|rsync -a /mnt/backup/localhost/daily.0/ /mnt/myroot/}}
where {{Path|/mnt/myroot}} is the mount point of the fresh root filesystem. In the paths above ''*.0'' refers to the latest increment.

== Possible improvements ==
It is also possible to make remote backups via '''rsync''' or '''[[Wikipedia:Secure Shell|SSH]]''' -- see the ''rsnapshot'' man page for details.

=== BTRFS snapshots ===
If you are crazy enough to use btrfs you can leverage its snapshot feature with rsnapshot. Walter Werther has a guide on this: [http://wwerther.de/2011/10/migrate-rsnapshot-based-backup-to-btrfs-snapshots/]
