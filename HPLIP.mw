'''HPLIP''' ('''HP''' '''L'''inux '''I'''maging and '''P'''rinting) provides printer drivers for HP devices. It also includes scanner, fax support as well as service tools for various multi-purpose peripherals.

== Do you require HPLIP? ==

Using HPLIP is recommended for most HP inkjet or laserjet based printers. There may however be devices which work with a default CUPS install, which provides adequate drivers or PPD files.

For some devices the driver is needed because a binary plugin which is installed with the driver is required to be able to use all features of the device (i. e. printing or scanning is not possible without the plugin), to achieve a better printing quality or to speed up printing. See the [[#Binary plugins|binary plugins]] section for more information.

== Installation ==
{{Warning|From my experience, disabling the net-print/hplip package USE Flags may result in a non-working scanner, fax or even printer because the HPLIP code seems to be poorly engineered. Even such commonly already disabled by default USE Flags such as the "fax" USE Flag could disable printing or hp-setup from properly executing. This is because the vanilla HPLIP package provided by HP just assumes you're installing with all dependencies already installed. As such, the HPLIP package is not bug free from handling such unique scenarios where a user does not require FAX, scanner or other dependencies.}}

{{Note|All users who need to manage printers i.e. using the web interface or hp-setup have to be a member of the lpadmin group. Editing the cups configuration files with a text editor however requires root privileges. For users who just need to print no special privileges or group membership is required.}}

For printing support, it is recommended to use the new hpcups driver, which you can enable with the ''hpcups'' USE flag. The old hpijs driver is still included when you build HPLIP with the ''hpijs'' USE flag.

The default install enables dynamically generated ppd files at runtime. Some printers may still require static ppd files. If you encounter problems when using '''hp-setup''' try enabling the ''static-ppds'' USE flag and rebuild HPLIP.

For USB printers {{Package|net-print/cups}} has to be built with the ''usb'' USE flag. This way it makes use of the {{Package|dev-libs/libusb}} user space tool which replaces kernel usb printer support (CONFIG_USB_PRINTER). In case of problems you can disable the ''usb'' USE flag for {{Package|net-print/cups}} and activate the kernel functionality again.

To be able to set up a network printer {{Package|net-print/cups-1.5}} has to be built with USE ''avahi'' or ''slp''. The 1.6 series of {{Package|net-print/cups}} has dropped slp support and one can choose to build it with USE ''avahi'' or ''zeroconf''. To be able to print on a network printer HPLIP needs to be built with USE ''snmp''. 

For some scanner devices the appropriate sane backend needs to be activated. To find out which backend is required for your device go to the sane projects [http://www.sane-project.org/cgi-bin/driver.pl driver search engine] and search for 'HEWLETT-PACKARD' as manufacturer. This provides a list of all supported devices including the required backend. For instance if the device needs the hp backend the following must be added to the portage configuration to build it when installing {{Package|media-gfx/sane-backends}}:

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
SANE_BACKENDS="hp"
</pre>}}

{{Note|The hpaio backend is provided by HPLIP itself if the ''scanner'' USE flag is activated. If this backend is needed no additional configuration needs to be done as the following settings should already be defined in {{Path|/etc/sane.d/dll.conf}}.}}

{{File|/etc/sane.d/dll.conf||<pre>
# Add support for the HP-specific backend.  Needs net-print/hplip installed.
hpaio
</pre>}}

=== Kernel ===
USB port connected devices require basic kernel USB support. When using the old kernel USB printer driver which means not using the ''usb'' USE flag the following kernel options must be set:
{{Kernel|Optional: USB printer support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    [*] USB support  --->
        <*> USB Printer support
</pre>}}
If preferred this driver can be enabled as module which will be called '''''usblp'''''. This also makes testing the ''usb'' USE flag easier as one can simple switch between both methods by either disabling the USE flag and load the kernel module or enable the USE flag and unload the kernel module via '''modprobe'''. This saves kernel recompilations and machine restarts and only HPLIP needs to be recompiled for the USE flags changes to take effect. If the module should permanently disabled it can be blacklisted to prevent automatic loading at boot time.

Load the '''''usblp''''' kernel module:
{{RootCmd|modprobe usblp}}
Unload the '''''usblp''''' kernel module:
{{RootCmd|modprobe -r usblp}}
Blacklist the '''''usblp''''' kernel module:
{{RootCmd|echo "blacklist usblp" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf}}

Parallel port connected devices require the following kernel options:
{{Kernel|Optional: Parallel port printer support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    <*> Parallel port support  --->
        <*>   PC-style hardware
        [*]   IEEE 1284 transfer modes
    Character devices  --->
        <*> Parallel printer support
</pre>}}

The above two methods are usually already enabled within most kernels.

Network connected devices do not require special kernel drivers but basic kernel network support.

=== Software ===
Install {{Package|net-print/hplip}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-print/hplip
|X+yes
|doc
|fax
|hpcups+yes+yes
|hpijs++no
|kde+yes
|libnotify+yes
|minimal++no
|policykit+yes
|parport
|qt4+yes
|scanner
|snmp
|static-ppds
}}

{{Emerge|hplip}}

== Configuration ==

=== Printers and Faxes ===
{{Note|Make sure your USB printer is plugged into your computer or your network
printer into the network socket.}}

If installed with enabled ''qt4'' USE flag, use the "HP Device Manager" to configure your devices.

Alternatively you can run '''hp-setup''' in a terminal:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup}}

For network printer also specify the printer's IP address:
{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27}}

Afterwards you should restart the cups daemon:
{{RootCmd|rc-service cupsd restart}}

=== Scanners ===
Overall, scanners should just work and will be detected with XSane etc.

== Testing ==

=== Printer ===
After completing hp-setup you should be provided with the option of printing a test page. You can do this later using the "HP Device Manager" or the CUPS web interface which is located at http://localhost:631/.

=== Scanner ===
Use '''xsane''' and then press the preview button to ensure the scanner driver is installed and working properly.

== Upgrading ==

Every time when upgrading HPLIP run '''hp-setup -r''' to remove all printers and configure them again as described above in the configuration section.

== Binary plugins ==

There are some devices which require a binary plugin to use all functions the device provides. A list with devices requiring the binary plugin including the reasons why it is needed is available at the project's [http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/plugin.html homepage]. Gentoo currently does not support the binary plugin. '''hp-setup''' however tries to automatically install the plugin. The installed files are out of portage's control and are located under {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/data/firmware/}} {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/data/plugins/}} and {{Path|/usr/share/hplip/prnt/plugins/}}.
For installing just the plugin without configuring printer queues '''hp-plugin''' is available.
If installing the plugin fails with '''hp-setup''' or '''hp-plugin''' the plugin installer is available for download [http://www.openprinting.org/download/printdriver/auxfiles/HP/plugins/ here]. To install the plugin the downloaded *.run file has to executed in a shell:

{{RootCmd|sh hplip-version-plugin.run}}

Afterwards follow the instructions of the installer similar to '''hp-setup''' or '''hp-plugin'''

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Printing Paused ===
If printing does not immediately occur after submitting a print job, make sure the printer quene is not paused.  Check the CUPS printer administration interface and make sure the printer is not in a paused state.  I have no idea why the printer will sporadically enter a paused state.  It is something that should not happen, unless the user or administrator explicitly pauses the printer!

=== /usr/libexec/cups/backend/hp failed ===
{{RootCmd|rc-service cupsd stop
|cp /etc/cups/printers.conf /etc/cups/printers.conf.20121104}}

Edit this {{Path|/etc/cups/printers.conf}} and remove the lines prefixed with "State", "Reason" and "Type".

Upon saving the file and restarting the cupsd daemon, printing should resume.

==== Misleading Generic Error ====
{{Note|The above is a misleading solution to this very common generically reported error.  Sometimes, even setting the HP printer to the default or unpausing the printer might resolve the error.  THIS IS THE WORSE AND MOST ANNOYING UNMAINTAINED BUG I HAVE EVER SEEN WITH HPLIP or HP Printers!  It will make you want to avoid HP printers like the plague, due to broken packages, broken upgrades, and unfixed bugs within HPLIP, as this is the only error you get at most times!}}

I recently found, while trying to manage this error or install the HPLIP package, only using this command line method resulted in a working printer.  Although command line tools should be extremely stable, with HPLIP whether command line or graphical tools are more stable, is extremely erratic.

{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27}}

If this doesn't work, then try to enable the fax USE Flag as well.  It appears the dependencies for the fax USE Flag will be required, even when specifying no fax USE Flag, within hplip-3.13 versions.

{{RootCmd|<nowiki>USE="fax" emerge -q hp-setup</nowiki>}}

Pulling in extra, usually not needed dependencies, is another strong sign; those coding the hplip package are just hacking and requiring every package even though they do not use the packages.  Or, they're poorly documenting while they're coding.  Either way, nothing looks pretty from my user perspective, something a user should not be experiencing!

=== Error on install "File "./plugin_install.py", line 78 except ImportError, e:" ===
PROBLEM: A snipping of the error follows.

{{RootCmd|hp-setup -i 192.168.1.27|output=<pre>

</pre>}}

SOLUTION: Python 3 is set as main python interpreter. HPLP currently does not work correct with python 3. Switching back to python 2 by using '''eselect python''' fixes this. 

{{Note|Python 2 is still the recommended python interpreter for Gentoo. When using python 3 you should be aware of potential issues.}}

This is further documented at the {{Bug|718069|site=launchpad}}

=== HPLIP ebuild Upgrades Do Not Upgrade Binary Plugin(s) ===
PROBLEM: The HPLIP ebuild itself does not upgrade the binary plugin(s) when the ebuild is upgraded.  A symptom of this problem, you may get segfaults when starting XSane. (i.e. The HP LaserJet M1522nf requires a binary plugin for using the scanning feature.)

SOLUTION: Following the upgrade instructions should take care of this as '''hp-setup''' tries to upgrade the plugin.

=== Printing Weird Characters ===
PROBLEM: The printout contains weird looking characters.

SOLUTION: The printer likely can not handle Postscript Level 3 output. To work around, the printer's PPD file needs to be edited by replacing '*LanguageLevel: "3"' with '*LanguageLevel: "2"'.

See {{Bug|277404|site=launchpad}} which was initially opened in the year 2008 and {{Bug|19640|site=fdo}} for more information.

{{Note|<nowiki>Bug #277404 has not been fixed as of =net-print/hplip-3.13, and the PPD file installed is still being assigned "LanguageLevel 3" when specific HP printers do not support level 3!</nowiki>}}

{{Note| Even MS Windows prints using Postscript Language Level 2.  Even though the graphical interface might state Level 3, the graphic interface is lying and instead the code is hacked to print at Level 2.  Some distributions such as Ubuntu might also be hacked to print at Level 2, while also lying to users making them think they're printing at Level 2.  These are extremely significant signs of poor coding.}}

=== HPLIP Specific Printers More Stable within MS Windows ===
HPLIP specific printers appear to be more stable within MS Windows, and seems to be due to HPLIP not being properly maintained upstream.  HPLIP users should expect receiving the above error, "/usr/libexec/cups/backend/hp failed" for a multitude of reasons at least twice or more times a year.  When this disfunction occurs, it usually occurs during times when you need your printer the most!  Suggest a competiting manufacturer in order to work around these issues.  Personally, several years ago, I found HPLIP quite confusing when trying to utilize a command line only environment, which is indicative of somebody not properly building software from the ground up, and depending explicitly on X/Xorg.  Another bad sign this package is not maintained upstream, it still depends explicitly on Python 2 when installing the binary flatbed scanner plugin package, while still spawning a generic errors.

=== Possible Solution to Avert HPLIP Problems ===
There is a likely solution to averting all HPLIP's problems.  Currently there is a package within Gentoo Bugs tracker for net-print/hplip-plugins, but with a depend of net-print/hplip.  However, if this net-print/hplip-plugins package were to drop the net-print/hplip depend and only provide the binary plugins, for which is the number one reason why people install net-print/hplip, then it would appear many users would effectively evade all HPLIP errors and problems.  Likely 90% of the code within HPLIP are graphical utilities for FAX and FAX EMailing, along with FAX contacts.  HPLIP is not usually needed by most, as most printers already use a default CUPS PPD file and driver for printing, only providing binary scanner and maybe some binary printer drivers for some.  So, have net-print/hp-plugins EBuild install the binary drivers only without the net-print/hplip depend, perform some minimal configuration and further point users to another web page providing instructions or internal README for configuring their individual devices.  This would further follow the ideology of breaking each task into other separate tools, rather than providing one huge blob trying to do everything.

=== XSane "error during device i/o" ===
This error likely occurs because of installing an HPLIP package upgrade, without upgrading the binary plugin as well.  Even if you have manually upgraded using "hplip-plugin -i", a stale file (ie. /var/lib/hp/hplip.state) may still be leftover from a previous installation.  Also, the permissions may not be correctly set for this folder or file.  Manually removing this folder (ie. rm /var/lib/hp) and reinstalling the plugin should recreate the folder and resolve this error.  (Might find xsane can be run as root and not as user, even though the user is within the /etc/groups file.)
