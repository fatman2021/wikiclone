install {{package|net-irc/irssi}}:

{{emerge| irssi}}
To run the program, simply open up a terminal and type 'irssi', you can type 'irssi -h' to see all command line options.

==Configuring irssi==
The first time you run irssi a configuration file will be created for you in $HOME/.irssi/config.<br />
This can be modified with the /set command while in the client by typing '/set option value', type '/set' by it self to see all available options & their current value.
If you want your changes to stick over restarts, you will need to modify the configuration file for your irssi client.
