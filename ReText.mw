'''ReText''' is a Linux ready, simple but powerful text editor for Markdown and reStructuredText with a build in "Live preview" function.

== Installation ==

Emerge ReText just as you would any standard program:
{{Emerge|retext}}

Optional USE flags for ReText:
{{USEflag|package=app-editors/retext
|spell
}}

== Troubleshooting ==

If you start ReText and upon startup get messages such as these:
{{CodeBox|title=ReText message output|1=
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/bin/retext", line 1530, in <module>
  main(sys.argv[1:])
File "/usr/bin/retext", line 1517, in main
  window = ReTextWindow()
File "/usr/bin/retext", line 547, in __init__
  self.tabWidget.addTab(self.createTab(""), self.tr('New document'))
File "/usr/bin/retext", line 605, in createTab
  if self.useWebKit:
AttributeError: 'ReTextWindow' object has no attribute 'useWebKit'
}}
then you will need to build {{Package|dev-python/PyQt4}} with the ''webkit'' USE flag enabled. The way of resolving this issue is to modify your package.use file by adding <code>dev-python/PyQt4 webkit</code>:

{{RootCmd|echo "dev-python/PyQt4 webkit" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

For more information on USE flags please visit Gentoo's Official [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&chap=2 USE Flag Documentation].

{{Important|If you switch on ''webkit'' USE flag for {{Package|PyQt4}}, it require the package {{Package|libxml2}} with the '''icu''' USE flag enabled. This will most likely lead to unsolvable Portage conflicts. If you find yourself in this situation try adding '''icu''' as a global USE flag in your {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} and re-emerging world. It's a pain but it will fix the problem.}}
Modify:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|lang=bash|1=
USE="... icu ..."
}}
Finally rebuild your system's world. This should satisfy all related issues:

{{RootCmd|emerge -uN @world}}

If you've done everything correctly any packages that support ICU will be rebuilt, including webkit. The above command will probably take quite a while, but having a Markdown editor at your disposal is worth it, right?!
