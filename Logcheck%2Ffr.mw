Ce guide vous explique comment analyser les journaux système avec logcheck.

== Getting Started With logcheck ==

=== Background ===

<code>logcheck</code> is an updated version of<code>logsentry</code> (from the<code>sentrytools</code> package), which is a tool to analyze the system logs. Additionally,<code>logcheck</code> comes with a built-in database of common, not-interesting log messages to filter out the noise. The general idea of the tool is that all messages are interesting, except the ones explicitly marked as noise.<code>logcheck</code> periodically sends you an e-mail with a summary of interesting messages. 

=== Installing logcheck ===

{{Important|It is strongly recommended to remove logsentry if you have it installed on your system. Additionally, you should remove /etc/logcheck to avoid permission and file collision problem.}}

{{RootCmd|emerge -c logsentry}}

{{RootCmd|rm -rf /etc/logcheck}}

Now you can proceed with the installation of logcheck. 

{{Emerge|app-admin/logcheck}}

=== Basic configuration ===

<code>logcheck</code> creates a separate user "logcheck" to avoid running as root. Actually, it will refuse to run as root. To allow it to analyze the logs, you need to make sure they are readable by logcheck. Here is an example for<code>syslog-ng</code> : 

{{Code|/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf snippet|<pre>
options {
        owner(root);
  
        ## (Make log files group-readable by logcheck)
        group(logcheck);
        perm(0640);
};
</pre>
}}

Now reload the configuration and make sure the changes work as expected. 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/syslog-ng reload
|ls -l /var/log/messages|output=<pre>
-rw-r----- 1 root logcheck 1694438 Feb 12 12:18 /var/log/messages
</pre>
}}

You should now adjust some basic <code>logcheck</code> settings in {{Path|/etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf}} . 

{{Code|Basic /etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf setup|<pre>
# Controls the level of filtering:
# Can be Set to "workstation", "server" or "paranoid" for different
# levels of filtering. Defaults to server if not set.
## (The workstation level includes server, and server includes paranoid.
The paranoid level filters almost no messages)
REPORTLEVEL="server"
  
# Controls the address mail goes to:
# *NOTE* the script does not set a default value for this variable!
# Should be set to an offsite "emailaddress@some.domain.tld"
## (Make sure you can receive the logcheck e-mails. Testing is strongly
recommended)
SENDMAILTO="root"
  
# Controls if syslog-summary is run over each section.
# Alternatively, set to "1" to enable extra summary.
# HINT: syslog-summary needs to be installed.
## (If you get a lot of similar messages in the logs, you
may want to install app-admin/syslog-summary and enable
this setting)
SYSLOGSUMMARY=0
</pre>
}}

You also have to tell <code>logcheck</code> which log files to scan ( {{Path|/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles}} ). 

{{Code|Basic /etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles setup|<pre>
## (This is an example for syslog-ng)
/var/log/messages
</pre>
}}

Finally, enable the logcheck cron job. 

{{RootCmd|nano -w /etc/cron.hourly/logcheck.cron}}

{{Note|For more information about cron read the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Cron Cron Guide] .}}

Congratulations! Now you will be regularly getting important log messages by email. An example message looks like this: 

{{Code|Example logcheck message|<pre>
System Events
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== General tips ===

You can use the logcheck's <code>-d</code> switch to display more debugging information. Example: 

{{RootCmd|su -s /bin/bash -c '/usr/sbin/logcheck -d' logcheck|output=<pre>
