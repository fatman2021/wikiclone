|Gentoo on Android|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
This project is about running Gentoo natively on Android devices.
  
We will develop libc support and root permission handling in
Gentoo Prefix, and deploy the enhanced Gentoo Prefix in parallel to
Android userland in mobile devices, such as smart phone and
tablet. This will provide a full-featured native GNU userland to
Android system.
