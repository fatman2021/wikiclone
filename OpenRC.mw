'''OpenRC''' is a dependency based init system that works with the system provided init program, normally {{path|/sbin/init}}. It is not a replacement for {{path|/sbin/init}}. OpenRC is 100% compatible with Gentoo init scripts, which means you can probably find one for the daemons you want to start in the Gentoo Portage Tree. OpenRC, however, is not exclusively used by Gentoo Linux and can be used on different Linux and BSD systems.

== Features ==
'''OpenRC''' provides a number of features touted as innovative by recent init systems like [[systemd]] or upstart, such as hardware initiated initscript run or [[cgroups]] support, without requiring large layout changes to accommodate radically different designs and dependencies. See also [[Comparison of init systems]].

== OpenRC Busybox Integration ==
Busybox can be used to replace most of the userspace needed by OpenRC (init, shell, awk and other posix tools), by using a complete busybox as shell for OpenRC all the calls that normally would cause a fork/exec would be spared, improving the overall speed. This process isn't yet streamlined.

Busybox can be configured to contain 'start-stop-daemon', but the busybox version is not compatible with the one provided by OpenRC.  If enabled in busybox it will be used by default, causing init scripts to fail.  To avoid these problems be sure to set CONFIG_START_STOP_DAEMON=no in the busybox config file and rebuild it.

=== Replacing init ===
The sysvinit inittab provided by Gentoo is not compatible to the busybox init.

{{File|/etc/inittab|Example inittab compatible with busybox init|<pre>
::sysinit:/sbin/rc sysinit
::wait:/sbin/rc boot
::wait:/sbin/rc
</pre>}}

In order to set a specific runlevel from the bootloader the variable `softlevel=` should be used.

=== Busybox specific init.d files ===
TODO: busybox provides a number of applets that could be used to replace third party software like acpid or dhcp/dhcpcd.

=== Replacing udev with mdev ===
See [[mdev]].

== Using runlevels ==
OpenRC can be controlled and configured using '''rc''', '''rc-update''' and '''rc-status'''.

=== Named runlevels ===
OpenRC runlevels are directories living in "/etc/runlevels" to create additional runlevels is enough to issue

{{RootCmd|install -d /etc/runlevels/$runlevel}}

=== Stacked runlevels ===
Is possible manage variants using '''rc-update -s'''

An usage example for using stacked runlevel on laptop to group networking services based on location is at [[OpenRC/StackedRunlevel]]

=== Select specific runlevel at boot ===

Openrc reads the kernel commandline used at boot time, and will start the runlevel specified by the "softlevel" parameter if provided, instead of 'default'.

For instance, you can choose whether to boot into the 'default' or 'nonetwork' runlevels with the following example grub.conf configuration:

{{Code|/boot/grub/grub.conf|<pre>
default 0
timeout 5
#splashimage=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz

title=Regular Start-up
root (hd0,0)
kernel (hd0,0)/boot/kernel-3.7.10-gentoo-r1 root=/dev/sda3

title=Start without Networking
root (hd0,0)
kernel (hd0,0)/boot/kernel-3.7.10-gentoo-r1 root=/dev/sda3 softlevel=nonetwork

</pre>}}

== Prefix usage ==
[http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix Gentoo Prefix] installs Gentoo within an offset, known as a prefix, allowing users to install Gentoo in another location in the filesystem hierarchy, hence avoiding conflicts. Next to this offset, Gentoo Prefix runs unprivileged, meaning no root user or rights are required to use it.

By using an offset (the "prefix" location), it is possible for many "alternative" user groups to benefit from a large part of the packages in the Gentoo Linux Portage tree. Currently users of the following systems successfully run Gentoo Prefix: Mac OS X on PPC and x86, Linux on x86, x86_64 and ia64, Solaris 10 on Sparc, Sparc/64, x86 and x86_64, FreeBSD on x86, AIX on PPC, Interix on x86, Windows on x86 (with the help of Interix), HP-UX on PARISC and ia64. 

OpenRC runscript already support prefix-installed daemons, during the [http://www.awa.tohoku.ac.jp/~benda/projects/openrc.html SummerOfCode2012] work will be done to implement full secondary/session daemon behaviour to complete the overall feature set provided by Prefix.

[[OpenRC/Prefix]], a tutorial for trying it out.

== Hotplug usage ==
OpenRC can be trigger by external events, such as new hardware from udev. See [[OpenRC/Event_Driven]] for details.

== Other uses ==
* stateful init scripts and automatic respawning (run "rc")
