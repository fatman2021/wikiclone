== Introduction ==

In [[Project:Android|Gentoo on Android]], it is often preferrable to install into SD card to prevent internal flash from waring out, which is in-exchangable. In addition, quite a lot of embedded systems, for example [[Raspberry_Pi|Raspberry Pi]], use SD card as their default root filesystems.

Flash based storage (which SD card belongs to) is fundamentally different from magnetic-rotational counterparts (such as a hard disk), partitioning them under-optimized can result in severe I/O overhead which drains system performance and user experience.

Several studies and review articles are devoted on this topic, including [http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives], [http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/06/inside-the-ssd-revolution-how-solid-state-disks-really-work Solid-state revolution: in-depth on how SSDs really work] and [http://www.anandtech.com/show/2738 The SSD Anthology: Understanding SSDs and New Drives from OCZ]. These provide the fundations to the strategies in the remaint of this article.

SD card is similar to [[SSD]], except it's management layer is thiner and less smarter than those in [[SSD]]. In this survey, we document those which are not covered by [[SSD]].

== Find out Basic Parameters ==

There are some intrinsic parameters associated with each SD card, which determines the optimized units to do I/O operation. They are different kinds of access units, such as ''pages'', ''erase blocks'', ''allocation groups''. A survey of such parameters from different SD card available in the market can be found in the [https://wiki.linaro.org/WorkingGroups/KernelArchived/Projects/FlashCardSurvey Linaro wiki].

If your card is not listed, or you want to figure the parameters out by yourself, it is always possible to test and observe to time response of different access patterns by the [https://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=people/arnd/flashbench.git flashbench tool]. By following the README in the git repo, essentially you get a test result like this:

That is a class 10 32GB micro SD card by PQI tested by the author. Attention should be paid on the large jumps in the last column. In the example, from 1G to 2G (allocation group), 2M to 4M (erase block), 8k to 16k (multi-plane access), 2k to 4k (page). Despite of being only a reasonable guess not perfectly reliable, it do give us a guideline in tuning the filesystem parameter which result in performance boost in I/O.

== Partition Alignment ==

Make sure the partition is aligned to and allocated by erase blocks (in the above example 4M). At the time of writing, fdisk is the only tool known to support fine tuning of the alignment. (Neither sfdisk nor parted supports this.)

As this is not intended to be yet another tutorial on fdisk, you are referred to the ''repartition'' section of the article [http://blogofterje.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/optimizing-fs-on-sd-card Optimizing fs on sd-card for Linux/Fedora on Dreamplug].

== Filesystem ==

There are candidates for the filesystem. The survey is not yet completed and the recommendation is by no means final. You are always encouraged to extend this study with more insights and tests.

=== Solution 1: Use vendor default FAT ===

Most of the case an SD card is optimized to video streaming, in which large files are read/written continuously. Preformatted FAT partition is optimized for this purpose.

In order to support POSIX features required by Gentoo on FAT, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/posixovl posixovl] can be used. However, the test by the author indicates this solution is suboptimal. A reasonable guess is that, FAT does not perform well with lots of small files, and the overhead of fuse by posixovl degrades performance notably on embedded systems where CPU power are bottlenecks. At the time of writing there is no such kind of overlay filesystem in kernel space yet.

=== Solution 2: Tuned ext4 ===

'''This is the recommend solution.''' RAID feature of ext4 is expoited to match the I/O pattern of the SD card. As this tuning shares the same rationale with [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SSD SSD].

The recommend recipe is,<br />
 filesystem block = page
 stride = multi-plane access / page
 stripe-width = erase block / page

In the case above,<br />
 filesystem block = 4k
 stride = 4
 stripe-width = 1024

Mount the tuned ext4 with ''noatime'' option.

At the time of writing, there are some inconsistancy and confusion in the community for which parameter to choose and which definition to use, reflected partially by a survey of [http://thelastmaimou.wordpress.com/2013/05/04/magic-soup-ext4-with-ssd-stripes-and-strides Magic soup: ext4 with SSD, stripes and strides]. You are always encouraged to test out by yourself to find out the best parameters instead of following guides blindly.

=== Solution 3: Squashfs ===

Squashfs has been the best candidate filesystem for LiveCD/LiveUSB. However the Linux kernel of Android usually lacks squashfs and aufs. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/squashfuse squashfuse] or [http://podgorny.cz/moin/UnionFsFuse unionfs-fuse] suffers from one of the same issue as posixovl, namely the impact of fuse overhead on embedded systems.

== Appendix: Benchmarks ==

The recommendation of ext4 results from the following test. Its environment is Motorola Droid Razr XT910 with PQI class 10 32GB micro SD card, running Gentoo RAP. Squashfs mounted by ''squashfuse'', overlayed with ''unionfs-fuse''.

In the following table, ''block size'' is that of squashfs, ''comp'' is the compression algorithm of squashfs, ''overlay fs'' is the RW layer of unionfs-fuse on top of RO layer of the squashfs, ''host fs'' is the filesystem holding the squashfs image, ''emerge –help'' and ''lddtree `which mount.posixovl`'' are two commaneds used for benchmarking. 

The filesystems used are, ''ext3'' from internal flash of the XT910, ''ext4'' aligned and tuned ext4, ''fat32'' vendor preformatted fat32, ''fat32'' reformatted and tuned fat32.
