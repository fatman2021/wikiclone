'''LXQt''' is a lightweight desktop environment based on the Qt toolkit. It is the result of the merge between the LXDE-Qt and the Razor-qt projects.

== Installation ==

You can get the complete LXQt desktop environment by installing the {{Package|lxqt-base/lxqt-meta}} package:

{{Emerge|lxqt-meta}}

== Applications ==

Any application can be used with LXQt, but if you prefer Qt applications that don't depend on any component of KDE please see the [[Qt Desktop applications]] article.

== Support ==

Support for LXQt on Gentoo can be found in the #gentoo-qt Freenode IRC channel. Bugs should be reported at the [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ Gentoo Bugzilla].
