== Usage ==
Most of the time you will use TeX Live through the editor of your choice. Here a list of the different compiler to translate a {{Path|.tex}} document into {{Path|.pdf}}.

LaTeX:
{{Cmd|pdflatex mydocument.tex}}
XeTeX:
{{Cmd|xelatex mydocument.tex}}
LuaTeX:
{{Cmd|luatex mydocument.tex}}

=== Editors ===
There are several you can choose from in Gentoo. To list a few pure TeX editors:
* {{Package|app-editors/kile}} - [[KDE]] based editor, which lets you write in LaTeX code and then compile the document
* {{Package|app-office/texmaker}} - [[Qt]] based editor, which lets you write in LaTeX code and then compile the document
* {{Package|app-office/texstudio}} - Free cross-platform LaTeX editor (former texmakerX)
* {{Package|app-editors/gummi}} - GTK based editor, which lets you write in LaTeX code and then compile the document
* {{Package|app-editors/latexila}} - [[Gnome]] based editor, which lets you write in LaTeX code and then compile the document
* {{Package|app-office/lyx}} - Qt based [[Wikipedia:WYSIWYM|WYSIWYM]] editor, you type directly into the LaTeX document and can edit LaTeX code afterwards
* [http://www.tug.org/texworks/ app-editors/texworks] - Qt based editor, suggested editor by the UK-TUG which lets you write in LaTeX code and then compile the document. Can be found in the ''betagarden'' [[overlay]] as live ebuild.
* This is by far not a complete list.

Most of the editors support LaTeX syntax highlighting like [[Vim]], {{Package|app-editors/emacs}} (which supports compilation and previewing), {{Package|app-editors/gedit}} or {{Package|dev-util/geany}} and most development IDE's provide some plugins like {{Package|dev-util/eclipse-sdk}} and {{Package|dev-util/netbeans}}.

=== Programs with LaTeX support ===
* {{Package|net-im/pidgin}} - has a LaTeX plugin to display mathematical formulae
* {{Package|app-misc/freemind}} - has a LaTeX plugin for inserting formulae in mind maps

=== eselect pdftex ===
Gentoo would automatically clean out any previous version during upgrade. If you intentionally install several versions into different [http://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/slotting/index.html slots], there is a script that enables you to easily switch between them:
{{Emerge|app-admin/eselect-pdftex}}
You can list available distributions with the following command:
{{RootCmd|eselect pdftex list}}
To set the distribution:
{{RootCmd|eselect pdftex set 1}}

=== texdoc ===
Shows the original TeX documentation by keywords. For example everything about ''article'':
{{Cmd|texdoc article}}
This should open your default pdf viewer and show you the documentation.<br/>
In order to use ''texdoc'', you need to have the ''doc'' USE flag enabled for TeX Live and any module you want to have documentation about. 
To enable the ''doc'' USE flag on any TeX Live module automatically, you could use a wildcard:
{{RootCmd|echo dev-texlive/* doc >> /etc/portage/package.use}}
A full list of installed TeX modules can be shown with the following command:
{{RootCmd|qlist -C -I texlive}}
To enable the ''doc'' USE flag only for certain modules, add them to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}}. A quick way of adding them all:
{{RootCmd|qlist -C -I texlive {{!}} sed 's/$/ doc/' >> /etc/portage/package.use}}
{{Note|Afterwards you can edit the USE flags for each module in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} individually}}
