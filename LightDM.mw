LightDM is a cross-desktop display manager whose aim is to be the standard display manager for the X.org X server. The key features ( as listed by upstream ) are:
* A well-defined greeter API allowing multiple GUIs
* Support for all display manager use cases, with plugins where appropriate
* Low code complexity
* Fast performance
* No dependencies on Gnome libraries

== Installation ==
LightDM is available on Gentoo Linux and supports the following USE flags:
{{USEflag
|package=x11-misc/lightdm
|introspection+yes
}}

Starting from version '''1.1.3''', LightDM does not build any greeter, so you need to build them separately. The following greeters are available.

{{Package|x11-misc/lightdm-kde}}

{{Package|x11-misc/lightdm-gtk-greeter}}

{{Package|x11-misc/lightdm-razorqt-greeter}}

The following use flags are available for the GTK+ greeter.
{{USEflag
|branding
}}
 
You can install lightdm using the following command:
{{Emerge|x11-misc/lightdm}}

Install the appropriate greeter using one of the following commands:
{{Emerge|x11-misc/lightdm-kde}}
{{Emerge|x11-misc/lightdm-gtk-greeter}}
{{Emerge|x11-misc/lightdm-razorqt-greeter}}

== Configuration ==
The configuration file for LightDM itself is:
{{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf}}
=== KDE ===
{{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm-kde-greeter.conf}}

The LightDM KDE greeter also provides a KCM (KDE Control Module), which appears in the System Settings under ''System Administration'' → ''Login Screen (LightDM)''
=== Gtk+ ===
{{Path|/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf}}
=== RazorQt ===
* {{Path|TODO}}

To have lightdm start at boot set the '''DISPLAYMANAGER''' variable in {{Path|/etc/conf.d/xdm}} to ''lightdm'', as shown below:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm|Configure ''xdm'' to start lightdm|<pre>
...
DISPLAYMANAGER="lightdm"
</pre>}}
Finally, add xdm to default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm}}
