|netifrc on systemd|
<!-- Description goes here: --> 
In the past year, what was the classical network system on Gentoo, known as ''oldnet'', has been split to an independent package for improving maintenance, and is now known as ''netifrc''.

''netifrc'' provides a lot of advanced networking functionality (VLANs, bridging, bonding, pppoe, ipv6, ADSL, CCW and more), but is still dependant on OpenRC.
It would be nice for ''netifrc'' to remain a viable contender against other advanced network configuration systems, such as netctl.

For this project, you would implement a compatibility layer for ''netifrc'' usage of OpenRC functionality (this is started already as function.sh for systemd users in Gentoo), as well as provide systemd services to run each ''net.$IFACE'' service, via symlinks, similar to the existing net.lo to net.iface symlinks. This project would also encourage usage of ''netifrc'' OUTSIDE of Gentoo, so while any applicant should be prepared to start with ''netifrc'' on Gentoo, testing on a non-Gentoo distribution towards the end of the project should be included in any project proposal.
