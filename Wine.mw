'''Wine''' ('''W'''ine '''I'''s '''N'''ot an '''E'''mulator) is an application that allows Windows software to run on Linux. This article deals with installing, configuring and maintaining a general purpose Wine environment on Gentoo.

== Installation ==
Enable the USE flags of choice and emerge {{Package|app-emulation/wine}}:
{{Emerge|wine}}

== USE Flags ==
=== Media ===
Many users are likely to want support for as much media as possible, in which cases the following flags are recommended.
{{USEflag|package=app-emulation/wine

== Disabling the Menubuilder ==
To prevent Wine from adding menu entries and desktop links, the following dll override can be used.
{{File|~/.bashrc||<pre>
# Prevent Wine from adding menu entries and desktop links.
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winemenubuilder.exe=d'
</pre>}}

Already added entries can be deleted by removing the corresponding files from {{Path|~/.local/share/applications}}.

== Tools and Interfaces ==
Tools such as graphical interfaces for Wine for users who want an alternative to the command-line.
* {{Package|app-emulation/q4wine}} - Qt4 GUI configuration tool for Wine
* {{Package|app-emulation/wine-doors}} - Wine-doors is a package manager for Wine
* {{Package|app-emulation/winetricks}} - Easy way to install DLLs needed to work around problems in Wine
* {{Package|app-emulation/playonlinux}} - Set of scripts to easily install and use Windows games and software

== Debugging ==
If you find a bug and want to file a [http://bugs.winehq.org/ bug report] you'll probably be asked to try the latest version, and if you are not running ''testing'', you'll need to un-keyword it:
{{RootCmd|echo "app-emulation/wine" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}
Now when you update it you should make sure the ''custom-cflags'' USE flag is enabled, as debugging will be impossible without it.
