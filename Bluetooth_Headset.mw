This article describes the setup of a '''bluetooth''' headset.

== Prerequisites ==
A [[Bluetooth|Bluetooth installation]] must be done first. If you use ''simple-agent'', no GUI programs or applets are needed.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== No audio service is available ===
After updating to {{Package|net-wireless/bluez}}-4.97 it might happen, that a Bluetooth headset is connected, but [[ALSA]] / [[PulseAudio]] fails to pick up the connected device.

An error message like this might be shown in the output of PulseAudio:
{{Code|Debug output of PulseAudio|<pre>
I: [pulseaudio] module-card-restore.c: Restoring profile for card bluez_card.00_16_94_0B_6F_DE.
I: [pulseaudio] card.c: Created 10 "bluez_card.00_16_94_0B_6F_DE"
bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)
W: [pulseaudio] module-bluetooth-device.c: Bluetooth audio service not available
W: [pulseaudio] module-bluetooth-device.c: Service not connected
I: [pulseaudio] card.c: Freed 10 "bluez_card.00_16_94_0B_6F_DE"
E: [pulseaudio] module.c: Failed to load module "module-bluetooth-device" (argument: "address="00:16:94:0B:6F:DE" path="/org/bluez/31716/hci0/dev_00_16_94_0B_6F_DE""): initialization failed.
</pre>}}

To fix this, the following needs to be done:
# Enable the audio socket of bluetoothd
{{File|/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf|Enable audio socket|<pre>
[General]
Enable=Socket
</pre>}}
# Restart ''bluetoothd'' by doing one of the following things:
#* Turn the software wireless kill switch off and on again
{{RootCmd|rfkill block bluetooth
|rfkill unblock bluetooth}}
#* Turn the hardware wireless kill switch off and on again
#* Reboot the computer
# Reconnect the Bluetooth headset
