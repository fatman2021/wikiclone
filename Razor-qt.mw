'''Razor-qt''' is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments, Razor-qt also works fine with weak machines.

Razor-qt is currently being merged with the Qt port of LXDE, the final product will be called "LXQt". The first version (0.7.0) was released on may 7th, 2014, and there's [http://lxqt.org/ a preliminary website].

== Installation ==
For the complete Razor-qt desktop environment, install {{package|razorqt-base/razorqt-meta}}:
{{USEflag
|doc
|lightdm+yes+yes+Install LightDM display manager and Razor-qt's LightDM greeter
|policykit+yes+yes
}}
{{emerge|razorqt-meta}}

Razor-qt works with various window managers, and if you have none of the supported window managers installed, then the meta package will default to [[Openbox]], as that is what most of its developers use.

Alternatively, you can cherry-pick the components that you want, instead of installing the meta package.

== Configuration ==
Most of the configuration of Razor-qt can be done through the Razor Configuration Center, which you can select from the menu. 

Also note that you can configure generic Qt settings in ''qtconfig''.

== Applications ==
Most applications should work well with Razor-qt, but in case you want to keep in the spirit of a light-weight Qt-only desktop, please have a look at the recommendations on the [[Qt Desktop applications]] page. You can also use the qtdesktop set in the qt overlay.

{{package|x11-misc/compton}} can be used as compositor for transparency and shadow effects.

== Support ==
Support for Razor-qt on Gentoo can be found in the #gentoo-qt IRC channel and the [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-913958-highlight-.html Gentoo Forums Razor-qt topic]. Bugs should be filed at Gentoo's bugzilla.

== Development version ==
There are so-called ''live'' ebuilds in the '''qt''' [[overlay]], which can be easily added with [[layman]].
