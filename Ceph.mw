== Ceph Distributed Filesystem ==
[http://ceph.com Ceph] is a distributed object store and filesystem designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and scalability.  According to the [http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph_%28software%29#History Ceph wikipedia] entry, the first stable release (Argonaut) was in 2012.  It arose from a doctoral dissertation by Sage Weil at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Signficant funding came from the US DOE as the software has found early adoption in clusters in use at Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs.  The main commercial backing for Ceph comes from a company founded by Weil ([http://www.inktank.com/ Inktank]) which was acquired by RedHat in April 2014.

The Floss Weekly podcast interviewd Sage Weil in 2013 for their [http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/250 250th show].  The interview was done around the time that the "Cuttlefish" release was created.  One of the points of discussion was the need for datacenters to handle disaster recovery, and Sage pointed out that starting with Dumpling, Ceph would provide for replication between datacenters.  Another bit of trivia came out in the podcast: Sage Weil was one of the inventors of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring WebRing] concept in the early days of the World Wide Web.

=== Overview ===
Ceph consists of three major components:
* Distributed Object Store
* RADOS Block Device (RBD) and RADOS Gateway
* POSIX compliant Filesystem


==== Distributed Object Store ====
This component is always implemented in a Ceph rollout.  It sits on top of an existing filesystem such as [[Ext4|ext4]]
, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS xfs], [[ZFS|zfs]] or [[Btrfs|btrfs]] and is created and maintained by an Object Store Device Daemon (OSD).  It is up to the underlying filesystem and volume management scheme to provide the redundancy and reliability for the object storage and also the recovery that may be necessary when a drive fails and gets replaced.  

An OSD will take advantage of advanced features of the underlying filesystem such as Extents, Copy On Write (COW), and snapshotting.  It makes extended use of the xattr feature to store metadata about an object and will often exceed the 4kb limitation of ext4 filesystems such that a workaround will be necessary.  The ceph.com site documentation recommends either ext4 or xfs in production for OSDs, but it is obvious that zfs or btrfs would be better because of their ability to self-repair, snapshot and handle COW.  Ultimately btrfs will probably become the preferred underlying filesystem for a Linux based OSD when the majority is satisfied that it is stable enough.

The task of the OSD is to handle the distribution of objects by Ceph across the cluster.  The user can specify the number of copies of an object to be created and distributed amongst the OSDs.  The default is 2 copies with a minimum of 1, but those values can be increased up to the number of OSDs that are implemented.  Since this redundancy is on top of whatever may be provided the underlying RAID arrays, the cluster enjoys an added layer of protection that guards against catastrophic failure of a disk array.  When a drive array fails, only the OSD or OSDs that make use of it are brought down.

{{Note|Ceph documentation recommends that only one OSD be implemented per drive or logical volume.  This is both for performance reasons and to avoid the possibility that a volume failure doesn't cause a multi-OSD failure that destroys all copies of an object that have been created}}


OSDs are watched over by Monitor Servers (MONs) which act as the coordinators for object traffic. The initial Ceph Cluster would consist of a MON and two OSD servers, and this is the example used in their documentation for a quick install.  They also talk about an admin server, but this is only a system which is able to painlessly remote into the cluster members using ssh authorized_keys.  The admin server would be the system that the user has set up to run Chef, Puppet or other control systems that oversee the operation of the cluster.

A single MON would be a single point of failure for Ceph, so it is recommended that the Ceph Cluster be run with an odd number of MONs with a minimum number of 3 running to establish a quorum.  For performance reasons, MONs should be put on a separate filesystem from OSDs because they tend to do a lot of fsyncs.  Although they are typically shown as running on dedicated hosts, they can share a host with an OSD.  MONs don't need a lot of storage space, so it is probably perfectly fine to have them run on the system drive, while the OSD takes over whatever large disk or array is in the server.  A home user who isn't big on performance but nervous about an ssd based system disk and large numbers of fsyncs will probably just throw both the MON and the OSD into separate subvolumes of a btrfs based array.

MONs coordinate object traffic by implementing the Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing (CRUSH) map.  This is an algorithm that computes the locations for storing objects in the OSD pools.  MONS also keep track of the map of daemons running the various flavors of Ceph server in the cluster.  An "Initial Members" setting allows the user the specify the minimum number of MON servers that must be running in order to form a quorum.  When there are not enough MONs to form a quorum, the Ceph cluster will stop processing until a quorum is re-established in order to avoid a "split-brain" situation.

The CRUSH map defaults to an algorithm that automatically computes which OSDs an object should be placed, but it can be influenced by additional human specified policies.  This way, a site administrator can sway CRUSH when making choices such as:

* use the sites faster OSDs by default
* divide OSDs into "hot" (SSD based), "normal" and "archival" (slow or tape backed) storage
* localize replication to OSDs sitting on the same switch or subnet
* prevent replication to OSDs on the same rack to avoid downtime when an entire RACK has a power failure 


==== RADOS Block Device and RADOS Gateway====
Ceph provides support in the Linux kernel for the RADOS Block Device (RBD).  This is essentially a virtual disk device that distributes its "blocks" across the OSDs in the Ceph cluster.  An RBD provides the following capabilities:

* thin provisioning
* i/o striping and redundancy across the Cluster
* resizeable
* snapshot with revert capability
* directly useable as a KVM guest's disk device
* a variant of COW where a VM starts with a "golden image" which the VM diverges from as it operates
* Data Replication between datacenters starting with the Dumpling Release

A major selling point for the RBD is the fact that it can be used as a virtual machine's drive store in KVM.  Because it spans the OSD server pool, the guest can be hot migrated between cluster CPUs with little or no down time.  Libvirt and Virt-Manager have provided this support for some time now, and it is probably one of the main reasons why RedHat (a major sponsor of QEMU/KVM, Libvirt and Virt-Manager) has acquired Inktank.

The RBD and the RADOS Gateway provide the same sort of functionality for Cloud Services as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3 Amazon S3] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack#Object_Storage_.28Swift.29 OpenStack Swift].  The early adopters of Ceph were interested primarily in Cloud Service object stores.  Cloud Services also drove the intial work on replication between datacenters.


==== POSIX Filesystem ====
Ceph provides a MetaData Server (MDS) which provides a more traditional style of filesystem based on POSIX standards that translates into objects stored in the OSD pool.  This is typically where a non-Linux platform can implment client support for Ceph.  This can also be shared via CIFS and NFS to non-Ceph and non-Linux based systems including Windows.  This is also the way to use Ceph as a drop-in replacement for HADOOP.  The filesystem component started to mature around the Dumpling release.

Ceph requires all of its servers to be able to see each other directly in the cluster.  So this filesystem would also be the point where external systems would be able to see the content without having direct access to the Ceph Cluster.  For performance reasons, the user may have all of the Ceph cluster participants using a dedicated network on faster hardware such as Infiniband with isolated switches.  The MDS server would then have multiple NICs to straddle the Ceph network and the outside world.

=== Installation ===
As of this writing the stable version of Ceph in portage is <code>ceph-0.56.3</code> which corresponds to a midway rev of the second major release of Ceph code named "Bobtail".  In gentoo unstable are versions of the follow-on major Ceph updates up to the current major version "Firefly":

* <code>ceph-0.56.3</code> "Bobtail"
* <code>ceph-0.67.7</code> "Cuttlefish"
* <code>ceph-0.72.2-r3</code> "Dumpling"
* <code>ceph-0.80.1</code> "Firefly"

After noting that the ceph site online [http://ceph.com/download/ archive] only shows release downloads back to Cuttlefish, we decided to unmask unstable <code>ceph</code> in our <code>package.keywords</code> file along with its dependencies and ended up building with Firefly before doing our installation.

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

{{Note|The USE flags <code>libaio</code> and <code>radosgw</code> are local to the ceph ebuild.  Also even if you do build Ceph with libaio support, an OSD will not use asynchronous i/o by default.}}


==== Kernel Config ====
If you want to use the RADOS block device, you will need to put that into your kernel .config as either a module or baked in.  Ceph itself will want to have FUSE support enabled if you want to work with the POSIX filesystem component and you will also want to include the driver for that in Network File Systems.  For your backend object stores, you will want to have xfs support because of the xattr limitations in Ext4 and btrfs because it really is becoming stable now.

</pre>}}


==== Network Config ====
Ceph is sensitive to IP address changes, so you should make sure that all of your Ceph servers are assigned static IP addresses.  You also may want to proactively treat the Ceph cluster members as an independent subnet from your existing network by multi-homing your existing network adapters as necessary.  That way if an ISP change or other topology changes are needed, you can keep your cluster setup intact.  It also gives you the luxury of migrating the ceph subnet later on to dedicated nics, switches and faster hardware such as 10Gbit ethernet or Infiniband.  If the cluster subnet is small enough, consider keeping the hostnames in your /etc/hosts files, at least until things grow to the point where a pair of DNS servers  among the cluster members becomes a compelling solution.

We will be using four hosts in our Example implementation.  All four will be MON servers with an initial quorum of 3 so that we can safely avoid a "split-brain" situation and still be able to run the cluster when a single server is rebooted.

==== Our Example Ceph Cluster ====
We have chosen to roll out Ceph on a portion of our home network.  The four kroll hosts are as follows:

* kroll1 (aka Thufir) - An AMD FX9590 8 core CPU with 32GB of memory, 256GB SSD root drive and a 4x4TB SATA array formatted as a RAID5 btrfs with the default volume mounted on <code>/thufirraid</code>.  kroll1 will act as our admin server since the ssh keys for its root user have been pushed out to the other nodes in their <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> files.  Kroll1 will act as a MON and OSD server since only slightly less than half of the btrfs array has been used.
* kroll2 (aka Figo) - An AMD FX8350 8 core CPU with 16GB of memory, 256GB SSD root drive and a 4x3TB SATA array formatted as btrfs RAID1.  Kroll2 will act as a MON and MDS server.  We will not do an OSD server here since the array is already over 90% capacity.  Also the Ceph developers have suggested that it is not a wise idea to run an MDS and an OSD on the same node.
* kroll3 (aka Mater) - An AMD FX8350 8 core CPU with 16GB of memory, 256GB SSD and 4x4TB SATA array formatted as a RAID5 btrfs and default volume mounted on <code>/materraid</code>.  /materraid was being kept as a mirror of /thufirraid using <code>rsync -av --delete</code> on a periodic basis.  kroll3 will become a MON and an OSD server.
* kroll4 (aka Tube) - An AMD A10-7850K APU with 16GB of memory, 256GB SSD and a 2x4TB SATA array formatted as a btrfs RAID1 mirror set with its default volume mounted on <code>/tuberaid</code>.  As its real name suggests, kroll4 was originally set up a MythTV box, but its filesystem is only averaging about 10% of its capacity.  We will thus use kroll4 as a MON and OSD server.

Thufir, Mater and Tube run a gentoo stable desktop profile and are currently on kernel <code>3.12.21-gentoo-r1</code>.  Thufir and Mater are btrfs installs with new drives using the latest btrfs code <code>btrfs-progs-3.12-r1</code>.  Tube has been up and running a bit longer and had its btrfs array built under kernel <code>3.10.25-gentoo</code>.  Figo runs a gentoo unstable desktop profile and is currenly on kernel <code>3.13.7-gentoo</code>.  It is also being used as an rsync mirror for thufir, but its array has been running for about 2 years.  The reason for <code>/figoraid</code> running at 90% capacity is both due to older smaller drives (3TB versus 4TB) and also because the version of btrfs available when it was built did not yet include RAID5 support.


==== Editing the ceph config file ====
We will be following the [http://ceph.com/docs/master/install/manual-deployment/ manual guide] for ceph installation on their site.  There is also a python based script call ceph-deploy which is packaged for a number of distros but not directly available for gentoo.  If you can manage to get it working, it would automate a good bit of the process of rolling out a server from your admin node.

        #osd mkfs type = {fs-type}
        #osd mkfs options {fs-type} = {mkfs options}   # default for xfs is "-f"
        #osd mount options {fs-type} = {mount options} # default mount option is "rw, noatime"
</pre>}}


We use <code>uuidgen</code> to generate a new random uuid for the entire cluster.  We will rename the cluster name from the default <code>ceph</code> to <code>kroll</code> to match our host naming scheme.  We specify the 192.168.2 network to be the "public" network for the cluster.  Other default settings come from the manual install url mentioned earlier, including a default to replicate two copies of each object with a minimum of 1 copy allowed when the cluster is in "degraded" state.

We set a journal size in the <code>osd</code> global section but leave the filestore stanza commented out since we will be using btrfs for object stores instead of ext4.  We also added a little extra language to this to clarify exactly what it means.

We add a <code>mon</code> global section where we specify the list of hostnames that will act as mons along with their corresponding ip addresses.  The port number <code>6789</code> is the IANA registered well known port assigned to Ceph.  The initial members stanza specifies the three hosts which will be necessary to form an initial quorum.  The list of numbers corresponds to the list of mon sections that will follow for <code>mon.0</code>, <code>mon.1</code> etc.  These will also be used by the /etc/init.d/ceph startup script when figuring out which services are to be started for a host.

{{Note|The numeric mon convention is new in the Firefly release.  Earlier releases used alphbetical letters instead (eg <code>mon.a</code>, etc) for the <code>mon</code> sections.}}


The rest of the <code>ceph.conf</code> file consists of subsections for the various mon, osd and mds servers that we will be implementing.

</pre>}}


==== /etc/conf.d/ceph file ====
There is also a conf file for the ceph service, but as of the Firefly release, there is only the location of the conf file to specify.  This is because in previous releases, there was only an /etc/init.d/ceph script that needed to be worked with.  The single script would start up or shut down all of the services enabled for the site at once.  The ebuild maintainer changed this for Firefly to use renamed softlinks of <code>/etc/init.d/ceph</code> in order to specify the running of individual Ceph services.  It is somewhat similar to what gentoo does with <code>net.lo</code> when enabling network devices.

{{File|/etc/conf.d/ceph|Barebones ceph file for Firefly release|<pre>

==== Creating Keyrings For MON rollout====
Ceph uses its own shared secret concept when handling communications among cluster members.  We must generate keyring files that will then be distributed out to the servers that will be set up among the cluster members.  The keyrings are generated by the <code>ceph-authtool</code> command.  The first keyring is for the mon servers.  The manual install url has it going to a file on <code>/tmp</code>, but we are more inclined to keep it around by parking it in <code>/etc/ceph</code>

{{RootCmd|ceph-authtool --create-keyring /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring --gen-key -n mon. --cap mon 'allow *'|output=<pre>
creating /etc/ceph/ceph.mon.keyring
</pre>}}


The result is a readable text file:

{{File|/etc/ceph/ceph.mon.keyring|ceph-authtool generated file|<pre>
[mon.]
        key = (redacted key text)
        caps mon = "allow *"
</pre>}}


Next we create an admin keyring file which goes into <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring</code>.  

{{RootCmd|ceph-authtool --create-keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring --gen-key -n client.admin --set-uid{{=}}0 --cap mon 'allow *' --cap osd 'allow *' --cap mds 'allow'|output=<pre>
creating /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring
</pre>}}


The resulting text file may actually be shorter than the complicated command line used to create it.  The redacted key here is the same as the one that appears in our mon keyring, so it must be based on the uuid we parked in the <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code> config file.

{{File|/etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring|ceph-authtool generated admin file|<pre>
[client.admin]
        key = (redacted key text)
        auid = 0
        caps mds = "allow"
        caps mon = "allow *"
        caps osd = "allow *"
</pre>}}


This next command is just as annoying, because it wasn't until after running it that we discovered that the auth tool basically just appended the client admin keyring file contents to the mon keyring file.

{{RootCmd|ceph-authtool /etc/ceph/ceph.mon.keyring --import-keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring|output=<pre>
importing contents of /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring into /etc/ceph/ceph.mon.keyring
</pre>}}


{{File|/etc/ceph/ceph.mon.keyring|mon keyring with client admin contents|<pre>
[mon.]
        key = (redacted)
        caps mon = "allow *"
[client.admin]
        key = (redacted)
        auid = 0
        caps mds = "allow"
        caps mon = "allow *"
        caps osd = "allow *"
</pre>}}


We push the mon and client keyrings out to <code>/etc/ceph</code> on the other kroll hosts.
{{RootCmd|scp ceph.mon.keyring ceph.client.admin.keyring kroll2:/etc/ceph|output=<pre>

==== Creating the initial monmap file ====
The OSD and MDS servers use the <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code> for discovering MON servers, but the MON servers themselves have a much stricter consistency scheme in order to form and maintain their quorum.  When up and running the quorum uses majority rule voting system called Praxis, but MONs do work with an initial binary file called a monmap when you first set up the Ceph cluster.

The [http://ceph.com/docs/master/install/manual-deployment/ manual deployment] page covers the example where only a single MON is used to form the quorum.  We referred to the [http://ceph.com/docs/master/rados/configuration/mon-config-ref/#data Monitor Config] reference page and the [http://ceph.com/docs/master/dev/mon-bootstrap/ Monitor Bootstrap] page it refers to when creating our scheme with an initial quorum of three MONs.

The <code>monmap</code> command is used to create the initial monmap binary file.  We essentially give it the addresses corrsponding to our <code>mon.0, mon.1, mon.2</code> <code>initial members</code> and the cluster fsid from <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code> file.  We will park this file in <code>/etc/ceph</code> and then pass it around to the right place when we configure our MON hosts.

{{RootCmd|monmaptool  --create --add mon.0 192.168.2.1 --add mon.1 192.168.2.2 --add mon.2 192.168.2.3 --fsid 1798897a-f0c9-422d-86b3-d4933a12c7ac initial-monmap|output=<pre>

monmaptool: set fsid to 1798897a-f0c9-422d-86b3-d4933a12c7ac
monmaptool: writing epoch 0 to initial-monmap (3 monitors)
</pre>}}


We push the initial monmap file out to the other <code>/etc/ceph</code> directories on kroll2, 3 and 4.

{{RootCmd|scp initial-monmap kroll2:/etc/ceph|output=<pre>
initial-monmap                                                    100%  481     0.5KB/s   0.5KB/s   00:00    
</pre>}}

</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|scp initial-monmap kroll4:/etc/ceph|output=<pre>

</pre>}}



==== Creating kroll1 server mon.0 ====
Ceph servers look for their file trees in <code>/var/lib/ceph</code>.  Mon servers look for their server id number subtree under <code>/var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph.N</code> where N is the id # that we designated for the server in <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code>.  Kroll1 will host mon.0, so we create <code>/var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph.0</code> for it.  This implies that we will be using our 256GB SSD root system device for mon.0's i/o.  Later on when we create the OSD for kroll1, we will be creating and mounting a btrfs subvolume for it to use.  Otherwise the object store would default to eating us out of house and home on our system drive!

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-0|}}

Before continuing on, you may want to look at <code>/var/log/ceph</code> to clear out anything that may be in there.  The next command will create an empty <code>/var/log/ceph/ceph-mon.0.log</code> file if it doesn't already exist.

{{RootCmd|cd /var/log/ceph}}
{{RootCmd|rm -rf *}}
{{RootCmd|cd /etc/ceph}}

The <code>ceph-mon</code> command will populate the ceph.0 directory with a copy of our ceph.mon.keyring file renamed to <code>keyring</code> and a <code>store.db</code> directory tree which is a Praxis database reflecting the contents of the initial monmap file.

{{RootCmd|ceph-mon --mkfs -i 0 --monmap initial-monmap --keyring ceph.mon.keyring|output=<pre>
ceph-mon: set fsid to 1798897a-f0c9-422d-86b3-d4933a12c7ac

</pre>}}


We set up the mon.0 server startup in /etc/init.d by softlinking.  Examination of the ceph script reveals that the gentoo ebuild developer was merely picking the server type and id # from string positions in the script file name.  Thus it isn't crucial to use the "." and the "-" as we did here, but it does make things readable:

{{RootCmd|cd /etc/init.d}}
{{RootCmd|ln -s ceph ceph.mon-0}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add ceph.mon-0 default|output=<pre>
 * service ceph.mon-0 added to runlevel default
</pre>}}

{{Note|We won't start the server yet until after the other mon hosts have been set up.  Otherwise it would just sit stalled looking for its friends and periodically complaining into its log file in <code>/var/log/ceph</code>}}
{{Note|This author is not contemplating a move to <code>systemd</code> any time soon after prior ugly experiences with it when it first started to appear on Fedora.  It is left as an exercise to the reader to figure out what sort of scheme will be necessary when they are not using <code>openrc</code>}}

We repeated the same process to create <code>mon.1, mon.2</code> and <code>mon.3</code> on the other kroll member hosts.

Notice the ".fault" entries at the bottom of the log.  We will continue to see them until the quorum is established.  We will also see them as outputwhen attempting to do monitor style commands such as <code>ceph -s</code> until there is a quorum.

===== Starting mon.1 on kroll2 =====
We start up the mon.1 server on kroll2.  The mon log for this server will show it discovering the kroll1 <code>mon.0</code> peer server, and the 2 start using praxis to hold a quorum election.  Until <code>mon.2</code> gets spun up, we still won't have a quorum.

There is now also a <code>ceph.log</code> for the cluster with a briefer summary.  There is a warning that the system drive is over 70% full on kroll1 since we have also been using it for a /home directory there.  We may migrate that to the btrfs array later if it becomes necessary.

And now we are four.  The health will stay at HEALTH_ERR or degraded until we get at least two OSDs spun up.  We need two since that's the default replication count for objects as set in the <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code>.

==== Creating osd.0 on kroll1 ====
We use <code>uuidgen</code> to create a unique id which will be used in our first osd.  With the mon servers up and running maintaining the server map in praxis, we will need to follow the id numbers returned to us from <code>ceph osd create</code> and then retrofit <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code> if necessary if we lose and osd later or do things out of order.

{{RootCmd|uuidgen|output=<pre>

{{RootCmd|ceph osd create fb84a114-e961-4a8d-98a3-0b263c003129|output=<pre>
0
</pre>}}

Since this will be the first osd for the mon servers, we get assigned id 0 to create <code>osd.0</code> on kroll1.  As we have noted earlier, kroll1 (Thufir) already has a btrfs raid5 array up and running with the default volume mounted on <code>/thufirraid</code>.  The "normal" content is in the subvolume <code>raid</code> which is mounted on <code>/raid</code>.  We will add a new subvolume called <code>ceph_osd_0</code> which will be mounted to <code>/var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-0</code> for use by the new osd server.

We add the new subvolume to our <code>/etc/fstab</code> and take the liberty of turning on automatic defragmentation and on-the-fly lzo compression for the subvolume.  The osd will actually manage some subvolumes of its own underneath this mountpoint (<code>current</code> and <code>snap.N</code> rolling snapshots).

The resulting filesystem looks like this:

</pre>}}


The <code>current, snap_1</code> and <code>snap_2</code> directories are btrfs snapshots.  The keyring file is a new unique key that was generated for <code>osd-0</code>.
{{RootCmd|cat keyring|output=<pre>
[osd.0]
        key = (redacted, unique to osd.0)
</pre>}}


We use <code>ceph auth</code> to transfer that into the praxis database in the mon servers.
{{RootCmd|ceph auth add osd.0 osd 'allow *' mon 'allow profile osd' -i /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-0/keyring|output=<pre>
added key for osd.0
</pre>}}


The <code>ceph_fsid</code> actually contains the fsid for the cluster from <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code> and not the one we passed when creating the osd itself:
{{RootCmd|cat ceph_fsid|output=<pre>
1798897a-f0c9-422d-86b3-d4933a12c7ac
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|grep fsid /etc/conf/ceph.conf|output=<pre>
        fsid = 1798897a-f0c9-422d-86b3-d4933a12c7ac
</pre>}}


We save the uuid we used for osd.0 in a text file in <code>/etc/ceph/osd_uuids.txt</code> just in case.  It would probably be a bad idea to try to recycle an osd id number if we ever have a filesystem go bad, but you never know...


We set up kroll1 as a host in the CRUSH map and make it part of the <code>default</code> osd tree.
{{RootCmd|ceph osd crush add-bucket kroll1 host|output=<pre>
added bucket kroll1 type host to crush map
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|ceph osd crush move kroll1 root{{=}}default|output=<pre>
moved item id -2 name 'kroll1' to location {root=default} in crush map
</pre>}}


We can now see kroll1 as a host in the default tree using <code>ceph osd tree</code>.  <code>osd.0</code> also appears but hasn't been assigned to a host.
{{RootCmd|ceph osd tree|output=<pre>
# id    weight  type name       up/down reweight
-1      0       root default
-2      0               host kroll1
0       0       osd.0   down    0
</pre>}}


We now put <code>osd.0</code> in the crush map under kroll1 with a default weighting value.
{{RootCmd|ceph osd crush add osd.0 1.0 host{{=}}kroll1|output=<pre>
add item id 0 name 'osd.0' weight 1 at location {host=kroll1} to crush map
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|ceph osd tree|output=<pre>
ceph osd tree
# id    weight  type name       up/down reweight
-1      1       root default
-2      1               host kroll1
0       1                       osd.0   down    0
</pre>}}


All that is left is to enable and start the osd.0 service.
{{RootCmd|cd /etc/init.d}}
{{RootCmd|ln -s ceph ceph.osd-0}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add ceph.osd-0 default|output=<pre>

</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|./ceph.osd-0 start|output=<pre>

With one osd spun up, our cluster is now operating in a degraded state.

==== osd.1 on kroll3 ====
<code>osd.1</code> will use our other big btrfs array on host kroll2 (mater).

{{RootCmd|uuidgen|output=<pre>

</pre>}}


Since we are visiting hosts in the right order, we get to set up osd.1 on kroll3 just as we had anticipated in our <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code> file.  Mater's btrfs array has its default volume mounted on <code>/materraid</code>
{{RootCmd|cd /materraid}}

After shoving a couple of data archives from /home to the /raid filesystem on thufir, we got the root drive down to 51% of capacity.  The cluster now shows HEALTH_OK.

We will now add our final (for the moment) object store as osd.2 on kroll4.  Its btrfs mirror set has its default volume mounted on <code>/tuberaid</code>.  It also has a different subvolume setup from thufir and mater.  Instead of mounting and exporting a single <code>/raid</code> subvolume, it has subvolumes for <code>/home, /mythtv</code> and a dedicated volume for virtual machines as <code>/vm</code>.  Another wrinkle is that this system has been set up to use btrfs on the SSD for its /boot and / drives.  In fact, the root drive is mounted as a subvolume of <code>/systemraid</code>

It suddenly strikes us that we are the almost assuredly the first kid in our neighborhood to set up a cluster with almost 40tb of distributed object store in the comfort of our own home.  In fact, we are probably outclassing all but one or two NIH funded research labs that are nearby.  The cost of the hardware was probably in the range of $5-7K since it was built from scratch, and it may even been cheaper than a single desktop video editing system sold by a certain fruity computer company.


==== Setting up mds.0 on kroll2 ====
The Ceph site wants us to use ceph-deploy to set up the mds servers, but that script has yet to be ported and packaged for Gentoo.  We found enough information from a [http://www.sebastien-han.fr/blog/2013/05/13/deploy-a-ceph-mds-server/ bloggers site] to do a manual install for Gentoo.  The <code>/etc/ceph/ceph.conf</code> needs an edit to introduce a global <code>[mds]</code> section for the default location of the mds server and the keyring that it needs.

{{File|/etc/ceph/ceph.conf|edited for new [mds] global section|<pre>

        #auth supported = cephx

        # or disable authentication with "auth" entries in [global].

</pre>}}


The rest of the file stays untouched including the [mds.0] section that we had put in much earlier.  We pass around the updated conf file to the other hosts.

{{RootCmd|cd /etc/ceph}}
{{RootCmd|scp ceph.conf kroll2:/etc/ceph|output=<pre>

</pre>}}


On kroll2 we create the mds-0 directory and then use <code>ceph auth</code> to create its keyring.  The result is only a single file with a simple key value stanza.
{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /var/lib/ceph/mds/mds-0}}
{{RootCmd|ceph auth get-or-create mds.0 mds 'allow ' osd 'allow *' mon 'allow rwx' > /var/lib/ceph/mds/mds-0/keyring}}
{{RootCmd|cd /var/lib/ceph/mds/mds-0}}
{{RootCmd|ls -l|output=<pre>

</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|cat keyring|output=<pre>
[mds.0]
        key = (redacted key text)
</pre>}}


We then create a softlink of the ceph openrc script to enable and start mds-0.
{{RootCmd|cd /etc/init.d}}
{{RootCmd|ln -s ceph ceph.mds-0}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add ceph.mds-0 default|output=<pre>
 * service ceph.mds-0 added to runlevel default
</pre>}}
{{RootCmd|./ceph.mds-0 start|output=<pre>

starting mds.0 at :/0                                                                                   [ ok ]
</pre>}}


Looking at the ceph-mds-0.log and the <code>ceph -s</code> command shows us that everything is fine and we now have an mds server running.  We should now be able to use mount.ceph and export out the ceph namespace over nfs and cifs.

==== Creating and exporting the Posix Filesystem ====
Once again, the Ceph web site offered scant details about how to go about mounting the object store as a Posix Filesystem with cephx authentication.  After a lot of googling around after mount errors 5, etc, we hit upon the magic sauce that is necessary.  If you have compiled the ceph network filesystem and ceph lib as modules, you do not need to worry about a manual modprobe to have them loaded.  The <code>mount.ceph</code> command will take care of that for you.  You can confirm that the following two modules are loaded after trying your first mount:

{{RootCmd|lsmod | grep ceph|output=<pre>
ceph                  125992  1 
libceph               114568  1 ceph
</pre>}}

If you remember, the ceph.client.admin.keyring you created back in the beginning of the install included allow for mds operations.  However the format of that keyring file will not work with mount.ceph.  We need to copy only the key value itself as the contents of an <code>/etc/ceph/admin.secret</code> file.

{{File|/etc/ceph.client.admin.keyring|existing generated file|<pre>
[client.admin]
        key = (redacted key text)
        auid = 0
        caps mds = "allow"
        caps mon = "allow *"
        caps osd = "allow *"
</pre>}}

{{File|/etc/admin.secret|hacked up copy of ceph.client.admin with just the key|<pre>
(redacted key text)
</pre>}}

Because we are using nfs4, we will create an <code>/export/kroll</code> and then use mount.ceph to mount to that.  The user specified is just "admin", not "client.admin".  Since we have four mons up, we will go ahead and specify all of them to mount the root ceph object namespace.
{{RootCmd|mkdir /export/kroll}}

And now we have a gi-normous empty filesystem hanging off of /export/kroll.  The 46% capacity filled there are from the non-ceph btrfs subvolumes that are currently in the three arrays that are providing our object stores.  We will modify our /etc/exports and then update the sharing to put out /export/kroll.
