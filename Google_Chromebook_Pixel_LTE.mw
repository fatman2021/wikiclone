== Warning ==

This document describes how I installed Gentoo on google's chromebook
pixel LTE. These were very dangerous steps that could cause serious
damage. I strongly advise against using any of these steps. I take no
responsibility if someone uses this information.

Any views presented are my own and not representative of any company
or organization.

== Hardware disadvantages ==

Glossy screen. Very hard to do any serious work on. And when working
on dark background (e.g. console), I have a mirror instead of a
display. :-(

No ethernet socket. This forced me to buy a USB dongle network card
and makes the machine more bulky and not as light, mobile, and
portable as advertised. Also external ethernet card probably uses
slightly more energy than a built-in would. The case (not including
screen) is around 2 mm thicker than ethernet plug, so they could have
included a plug. There was also a lot of space left inside the case. I
hope maybe they will have it in next version.

SIM card slot didn't open. This was a suprisingly low-quality
mechanism. I couldn't open it with a pin. There is no manual even on
google page how to do it. After trying for a few days, with pins of
various sizes, I gave up, only to find out later when I opened the
case that the mechanism was damaged by my trials.

I've read somewhere that it should be possible to use SIM cards from
other providers by executing something like 'modem_set_carrier Generic
UMTS' (don't remember exactly). However, when I run this command, I
got an error message saying that my modem doesn't allow changing the
carrier. :-(

No user manual of any kind (e.g. explaining how to enter BIOS, how to
replace SIM card).

Nothing is upgradeable, mSATA SSD drives don't work in the LTE modem
slot. It's the same mSATA socket, but only for the modem.

Battery is built-in. So no, I cannot have an extra battery when
traveling. And as soon as battery ages and it only holds for half an
hour, I'll have to buy a new laptop instead of just a new
battery. That's very nice planned obsolescence by google.

The SSD is SanDisk SSD i100 64 GB ATA-9 (61057 MiB). Small and not
too good quality. And soldered-in, can't be replaced if it fails. And
cannot be upgraded to something more robust or larger.

Not fanless and noisy. Sometimes when running dd I could clearly hear
some very high-pitched noise (not coming from the fan). At room
temperature of around 22 degrees Celsius, the fans start several
seconds after running any nontrivial task, i.e. any task that doesn't
sleep most of the time. Also, the case gets very hot compared to other
machines I've used. All of these thermal issues may have something to
do with unnecessary fact that google wanted to make the laptop look
beautiful, so they've decided only to have very narrow slit for
ventilation. I would rather prefer ugly laptop with big ventilating
holes with better thermal/cooling characteristics.

Very strange keyboard lacking many useful keys, e.g. PAGE_UP, PAGE_DOWN for
console scrolling, DELETE, HOME, END, CAPS_LOCK, etc.

The laptop has a fatal bug - when battery runs out to zero, my Gentoo
installation is erased. It's some kind of security measure. After
full discharge any non-signed OS is erased. And I need to install Gentoo
again from scratch. Needles to say this is a show-stopper.

A related problem is that the DC power plug does not sit firmly in the
laptop's power socket. It lacks some kind of "click" to hold it in
place. It can easily slide out without notice a couple of millimeters,
at which point the power no longer reaches the laptop.

Very little rubber on the bottom means the laptop slides on the wooden
desk all the time. If at least one of four small rubbers doesn't touch
the desk directly, I have to use both hands to open and close the lid.

Every time I boot I have to go through the scary 'OS verification is
OFF - press space to reenable' screen. If I do, I guess my whole
Gentoo installation will be wasted. Instead, a hidden combination
{{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|L}} must be pressed in order to boot. So I have to be very careful
each time I boot not to do what I'm told and not allow anybody else to
boot the laptop, as they would probably just press space as they are
told to and erase my Gentoo installation.

This also means that I cannot e.g. reboot the machine remotely, as
it will not boot without pressing {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|L}}.

I haven't found any way to set 'power on after power failure'.

All of that makes this machine almost useless as a remote server of
any kind.

I haven't found any way of entering and setting up the bios.

When using powersave or conservative governor, the CPU
frequency only falls to ~0.9 GHz. As I spend most time editing
text, 0.1 GHz would be enough. :-(

Only 4 ports, including only 2 USB 2.0.

The price was very high. It included a lot of crapware: 1 TB google
drive, 12 GoGo Internet sessions, US verizon LTE SIM card. This
crapware has many disadvantages: probably increased the price, will
probably not work with GNU/Linux, doesn't allow users to choose their
prefered service providers, etc.

The WIFI and bluetooth hardware cannot be removed or turned off by any
hardware switch. So if one works at a physics laboratory, airplane
cockpit, or in a hospital, where the rules forbid any RF emitters,
it's impossible to take it to work.

Completely useless 'light bar' (set of colorful LEDs), which just uses
precious energy.

Very square edges mean it's not very comfortable resting my hands
against them e.g. when operating the touchpad.

Slightly outdated CPU. Macs are updating to newest CPU with each new release
from Intel, but pixel is left with older CPU.

Only US plug included with the AC/DC power adapter. The plug is
actually removable, I guess so they can ship it with UK plug in UK, EU
plug in EU, etc. But since the plug costs nothing, they should give
me all the plugs so I can just use it when traveling instead of
having to search for power plug adapters. Especially in such an
expensive product.

== Hardware advantages ==

Touchscreen.

Intel GPU. For now Intel has the best open source driver support, so
it's least problematic.

I can run Gentoo on it without reflashing or resoldering anything and
without fighting any BIOS-OS DRM/cryptography. It wasn't easy, but
possible.

It's possible to open the case and remove the provided verizon SIM
card and LTE modem.

I removed LTE modem because I don't need it. I was worried that it
could be set up for some google+nsa spying. Also if it isn't there, it
won't use precious energy. And won't emit that energy needlessly into
my body.

Large screen resolution. However, after buying it, now I can see that
the text is still much, much more readable on my old matte 1920x1200
screen than on glossy 2560x1700 screen due to all the glare,
reflections, and the mirror effect.

No 'windows key', making CTRL and ALT larger and easier to use.

AC/DC transformer works also in Europe (but see the disadvantages -
the plug is US only, so power plug converter is needed).

== Hardware summary ==

Many more disadvantages than advantages.

So why did I buy it if it's so bad? Mostly due to 2560x1700 screen
resolution. I cannot stand the low 1920x1200 resolution and I wanted
to put my money where my mouth is and in this way vote for and
contribute to the increase of screen resolutions. Also because I have
only seen 'The Century of the Self' after I bought it. I got caught in
the net of consumerism. It was shiny and looked nice. But this
shinyness is inversely proportional to usability. Sure, if there's no
ports and no ventilation, it will look nicer. Only after I bought it
did I realize how much I need these ports (especially ethernet) and
ventilation. And how impossible it is to do any work on the glossy
screen.

All in all I give it a very generous 1 star (out of 5).

== Software installation ==

I followed advices to start the dev mode and boot from USB:

* http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/chromebook_pixel_linux.txt
* http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/chromebook-pixel
* https://plus.google.com/100479847213284361344/posts/QhmBpn5GNE9
* http://blog.brocktice.com/2013/03/09/running-debian-wheezy-7-0-on-the-chromebook-pixel/

I had problems starting dev-mode, because nothing happened when I
pressed {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|D}}. However, after shutting down 7-8 times, finally it
worked. Note: I tried with different time delays after seeing the
recovery screen. When it worked, I pressed it after around 3
seconds. And I could see whether it worked or not, because a
confirmation dialog was displayed.

I didn't need to use google acount. I could use the crossystem
command from guest acount, when in dev mode.

However, in order to use the guest account, I had to set up the chrome
OS, select keyboard, language, etc. I could only do it after
connecting to wireless network. That's right, I need to connect to
WIFI network before being able to install another OS. WTF? Probably
some google+nsa spying takes place, so I used public wifi access point
for this, so that they don't know my location. I haven't tested
whether maybe it would work with my wifi router after disconnecting it
from the Internet (so the laptop get wifi connection but cannot send
the spy data to google/nsa).

Also, during the chrome os setup in dev mode there was some small gray
link named something like "advanced security" (I don't recall exact
name). After clicking it, it displayed the Trusted Platform Module
password, which I remembered, as it could be useful some day.

Anyway the goal was to execute the following before I could boot from USB:

<pre>
shell
sudo bash
crossystem dev_boot_usb=1
</pre>

== Boot from USB ==

The minimal Gentoo ISO can easily boot. I put it on a USB stick:

{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}install-amd64-minimal-DATE.iso of{{=}}/dev/USB_DEVICE}}

My USB_DEVICE was {{Path|/dev/sdb}} on the machine where I did it.

== Installing Gentoo ==

For the rest of the installation I just followed the Gentoo Handbook,
with the following remarks.

After booting Gentoo from USB I backed up the whole SSD into another
USB stick ({{Path|/dev/sdc1}}) in case I want to easily recover chrome OS
without contacting google:

{{RootCmd
|mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/gentoo
|dd if{{=}}/dev/sda {{!}} gzip > /mnt/gentoo/pixel_dd_dev_sda.gzip
|umount /mnt/gentoo
}}

The resulting backup of whole 64 GB took only 1.5 GB after gzipping.

== Partitioning ==

I used whole {{Path|/dev/sda}} for partitioning. There were many partitions,
but I just removed all of them - I zeroed whole device to get rid of
GPT:

{{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/dev/zero of{{=}}/dev/sda}}

Then I used fdisk to create simple MBR partition table.

I have selected LILO as my boot manager, as it's easier to configure
and maintain.

== LiveCD networking ==

Unfortunately, the livecd didn't seem to contain ath9k module for
wifi, so there was no network connectivity (I didn't have the USB
ethernet card yet - later I verified that it was recognized by the
livecd). Fortunately, it is possible to install Gentoo without network
connection.

I downloaded stage file on the old machine and moved it to the new using USB stick.

I copied the portage tree from another fully updated machine:

{{RootCmd
|cd /usr/
|tar cjpf portage.tbz portage/
}}

Then I moved {{Path|portage.tbz}} to new machine using USB stick and untarred
it there. This included distfiles, so on the new machine I could
emerge packages I had on the old one without network access. It turned
out some distfiles were missing, but I could fetch them on the old
machine. I could check which files are needed by running:

{{Emerge|params+=-vf|foo}}

Then I observed which files were fetched and moved them using USB
stick to the new machine.

== Systemd ==

I have noticed after completing the handbook installation that udev is
not running. It was not added to sysinit and the handbook didn't link
to udev guide. But it did link to systemd guide as an option, and
therefore I installed systemd. It's magnificent and I hope it will
soon become the default!

To keep the console messages on first VT, I followed advice from [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=828007 this bug report].

That is, I put the following in {{Path|/etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service}}:

{{File|/etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service||<pre>
.include /lib/systemd/system/getty@.service
[Service]
TTYVTDisallocate=no
</pre>}}

And I rebooted.

== Console fonts ==

I wanted as large font as possible on the console. Since I used
systemd, I did:

{{Emerge|terminus-font}}

{{RootCmd|echo 'FONT{{=}}ter-v32n' >> /etc/vconsole.conf}}

== After-install networking ==

Of course when I built my own kernel, I can select the WIFI driver and
get wireless networking. So no wifi was only a limitation of live cd.

To get automatic static networking for the USB ethernet card under
systemd, I did the following:

I adjusted {{Path|lilo.conf}} as follows:

{{File|lilo.conf||<pre>
append="init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd net.ifnames=0"
</pre>}}

as I prefer that my device is called eth0 instead of enp0s29u1u2.

I created {{Path|/etc/systemd/system/staticnet.service}} and wrote in it:

{{File|/etc/systemd/system/staticnet.service||<pre>
[Unit]
Description=Static eth0 networking
BindsTo=sys-subsystem-net-devices-eth0.device
After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-eth0.device

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/bin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.109 broadcast 192.168.1.255 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
ExecStart=/bin/route add default gw 192.168.1.100 eth0

[Install]
WantedBy=sys-subsystem-net-devices-eth0.device
</pre>}}

Where eth0 is my device, 192.168.1.100 is my router's IP, and
192.168.1.109 will be my laptop's IP. Then I run:

{{RootCmd
|systemctl enable staticnet
|systemctl start staticnet
}}

This configuration starts the static networking as soon as I plug in
the USB ethernet card.

It was also necessary to put my ISP's nameservers in {{Path|/etc/resolv.conf}}
to be able to talk directly to the world.

== Kernel ==

I enabled the following in my kernel:

{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
  [*] Network device support  --->
    [*]   Wireless LAN  --->
      <*>   Atheros Wireless Cards  --->
        <*>   Atheros 802.11n wireless cards support
  Input device support  --->
    [*]   Touchscreens  --->
      <*>   Atmel mXT I2C Touchscreen 
  [*] Platform support for Chrome hardware  --->
    <*>   Chrome OS Laptop
</pre>}}

== /etc/make.conf ==

I added <code>-march=native</code> to the CFLAGS.

Also, to get the touchpad and touchscreen working I did:

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
INPUT_DEVICES="evdev synaptics"
</pre>}}

It's confusing, because these are Atmel maXTouch devices, not
Synaptics, but there was no corresponding INPUT_DEVICES
option. However, they seem to work this way.

The situation with the graphics driver is very confusing. The only
driver in current kernel is i915. However, the official Gentoo [[Intel]]
wiki article states that Ivy Bridge uses i965 driver. I couldn't find i965
neither in the kernel, nor as any package. What's even more confusing
is that mesa package allows all three options for VIDEO_CARDS: intel,
i915 and i965. But xorg-drivers only has one: intel. Not knowing what
I should do, I have enabled all three:

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
VIDEO_CARDS="intel i915 i965"
</pre>}}

It looks like there is hardware accelleration, however when I run the following command I get some error messages:

{{Cmd|LIBGL_DEBUG{{=}}verbose glxinfo > /dev/null|output=<pre>
libGL: OpenDriver: trying /usr/lib64/dri/tls/i965_dri.so
libGL: OpenDriver: trying /usr/lib64/dri/i965_dri.so
</pre>}}

But maybe it's harmless, I don't know.

Anyway, I tried some of the newest 3D indie games and they seem to
work, even those that claim to work only with nVidia or AMD
proprietary drivers, so I'm OK for now.

== DPI ==

Getting the huge DPI right in Xorg server is very difficult. X can see
my phisical screen size and resolution correctly, so it could just
calculate and set the correct DPI.  However, Xorg devs have officially
decided not to do automatic DPI detection and always force it to 96
DPI in order to be "compatible with MS Windows". This is embarrasing
and I lost any respect for them after reading that. The only way I
found to force the DPI I wanted was to manually modify the sources. I
looked for any file having any constant defined named *dpi* and having
value of 96. I found 3 places, replaced them with my wished DPI,
recompiled, and it works.

I hope to try soon Wayland, maybe it has automatic DPI detection.

Another option is to use Gnome 2. It allows to set its DPI in system
settings.

== Desktop environment ==

The big problem is finding any desktop being able to work well with
such high DPI. I tried Enlightenment, Xfce 4, Fluxbox, TWM, Gnome 3,
Gnome 3 classic, Gnome 2, KDE Plasma, KDE/Openbox and LXDE.

All of them suck at DPI close to 300. Problems include tiny icons,
tiny text, GUI elements not fitting in other elements, GUI not being
scalable, etc.

The one that sucked least is Gnome 2 (no, not Gnome 3 classic - this
sucked a lot). Here almost everything scales well, including text and
icons. Some elements still remain super small, e.g. scroll bars,
window borders, some icons. But it was the only one that I found
actually usable.

== Gnome 2 ==

Gentoo devs rock. They still allow installing Gnome 2, even though it's 2014.

Gnome 2 has its own DPI configuration in
System/Preferences/Appearance/Fonts/Details. This setting is respected
throughout the desktop, even without recompiling the X server with
modified DPI constants.

I was getting some compilation/linking errors. E.g. when gcc complained about
missing libm, I just added:

{{RootCmd|LDFLAGS{{=}}"-lm" emerge -a1v gnome-media}}

I didn't have any entries in Applications menu. But the elogv showed
me that gnome-menus package has left a note about this. In order to
get the menu, I had to start Gnome from GDM.

== GDM 2 ==

Starting GDM was not trivial, as version 2 ebuild does not provide a
systemd file. Well, just calling gdm was enough. It seems to
self-manage.

The themed greeter does not scale so well at high DPIs. However, the
simple one does perfectly, so I have configured GDM to use it.
