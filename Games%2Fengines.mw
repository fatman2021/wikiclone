It already features [http://games.renpy.org over 500 works] including a lot of manga and "boy pursues girl" stories (such as [http://games.renpy.org/game/otchi_kocchi_a1.shtml OTChi Kocchi]), but also more serious or even autobiographical stories (such as [http://games.renpy.org/game/homeward.shtml Homeward] or {{Package|games-misc/katawa-shoujo}}) and some extensive RPGs (such as [http://games.renpy.org/game/loren-amazon-princess.shtml Loren the amazon princess] or [http://games.renpy.org/game/planetstronghold.shtml Planet Stronghold]). It also comes with it's own IDE (development useflag) and is slotted, because new versions are sometimes incompatible with older games. You can control the default slot via "eselect renpy".
