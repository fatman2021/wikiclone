'''xmonad''' is a fast and lightweight tiling-windowmanager for X11 written, configured and extended in the purely-functional programming language [[Haskell]].

== Installation ==
Generally, there are two ways to install XMonad:
* Install {{Package|x11-wm/xmonad}}
{{Emerge|xmonad}}
OR 
* Install it with [[Haskell#Cabal|cabal]]:
{{Cmd|cabal install xmonad}}

== Configuration ==

=== Starting ===
To start xmonad you can use a [[display manager]] or startx.

If want to use startx and want [[ConsoleKit]] support, setup ConsoleKit and create the following file:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.xinitrc|lang=bash|1=
exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session xmonad
}}

=== ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs ===
XMonad itself can be configured through {{Path|~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs}} which is written in Haskell.

Minimal configuration file with default configuration:

{{CodeBox|title=Primitive xmonad.hs|lang=haskell|1=
import XMonad

main = xmonad $ defaultConfig
}}

Once you changed your config file you should compile it and restart XMonad.

{{Cmd|xmonad --recompile
|xmonad --restart}}

In most cases to write a config file you need additional features provided by xmonad-contrib library. You can install it from {{Package|x11-wm/xmonad-contrib}}
{{Emerge|xmonad-contrib}}
OR using [[Haskell#Cabal|cabal]]:
{{Cmd|cabal install xmonad-contrib}}

=== Adding status bars ===
Unlike many other window managers, XMonad does not have any built-in status bars. Instead of this it can pipe required information to external program.  Usually, xmobar or dzen is a good choice for status bar.

* Install {{Package|x11-misc/xmobar}}
{{Emerge|xmobar}}
OR
* Install {{Package|x11-misc/dzen}}
{{Emerge|dzen}}

== External resources ==
