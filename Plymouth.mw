'''Plymouth''' is used to show splash screens during boot and shut-down. It is a more modern alternative to [[fbsplash]] and provides flicker-free animated boot splashes  with a progress bar. It also has full [[systemd]] support. However, it does not provide eye-candy for the ttys in the way fbsplash does (meaning it shows no decoration on your consoles while the system is running).

== Installation ==

{{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}} can be installed using 
{{Emerge|sys-boot/plymouth}}

It will install a number of themes automatically.

However, [[genkernel]] cannot create an [[initramfs]] with a plymouth theme included. Therefore either [[dracut]] or {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}} is needed. We will here continue with genkernel-next as it is marked stable. The plymouth use flag needs to be enabled.
{{RootCmd|echo "sys-kernel/genkernel-next plymouth" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}
{{Emerge|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}}

== Configuration ==

The first step is to select a Plymouth theme. A list of all themes can be found using
{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme --list}}

Assuming we want to select the solar theme
{{RootCmd|plymouth-set-default-theme solar}}

Additionally we need to enable this theme in the initramfs generation:
{{File|/etc/genkernel.conf||<pre>
# Enable splashutils in early space (initrd). Default is "no".
# SPLASH="no"

# Installs, or not, plymouth into the initramfs. If "splash" will be
# passed at boot, plymouth will be activated.
PLYMOUTH="yes"

# Embeds the given plymouth theme into the initramfs.
PLYMOUTH_THEME="solar"
</pre>}}

Note that SPLASH should stay no because this parameter refers to fbsplash.

Next the grub2 config file needs to be changed to enable the splash during early boot.
{{File|/etc/default/grub||<pre>
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT='quiet splash'
GRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768x24
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep
</pre>}}
Adjust the resolution to match your primary screen.

As a last step you need to recreate the initramfs and then the splash screen should work on the next system boot:
{{RootCmd|genkernel all}}

Plymouth automatically registers itself with systemd to show a splash screen during shutdown/restart.
