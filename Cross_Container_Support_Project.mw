==Introduction==

This page is aimed to introduce the GSoC 2012 project: Cross Container Support.

I will document the progress of my project here.

==Running Qemu-user on Chroot==

This section updates the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/embedded/handbook/index.xml?part=1&chap=5 qemu-user] and describes how to build a chroot with qemu-user on x86 machine.

===Host Configuration===

====Qemu-user Installation====
In order to take advantage of qemu-user mode we need to do a few things. First we need to merge the main package we are going to need. Note the use of the static use flag.
Python is needed during qemu-user compiling.

{{RootCmd|echo "{{=}}app-emulation/qemu-user-1.1.0-r1 ~x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
|eselect python set python2.7
|USE{{=}}"static" emerge -b1 app-emulation/qemu-user
}}

====Binfmt_misc Configuration====

First you need to build the kernel module binfmt_misc. 
Add this to your kernel .config: CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC=m or CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC=y. 
If this module is not built already, then the devel host will require a reboot after the kernel update and modules_install.
The complete list of relevant kernel options (tested on 3.2.1-gentoo-r2) is as follows.

{{kernel|3.2.1-gentoo-r2|<pre>
Executable file formats / Emulations  --->
 [*] Kernel support for MISC binaries 
</pre>}}

Mount the binfmt_misc handler if it's not already, then we need to register our format with the kernel via the procfs.

{{RootCmd|[ -d /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc ] {{!}}{{!}} modprobe binfmt_misc
|[ -f /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register ] {{!}}{{!}} mount binfmt_misc -t binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
}}

Next, register qemu-user-arch to the binfmt_misc module. You don't need to add them one by one and Luca has provided a initscript to get the bin formats registered.
You can use it:
{{RootCmd| /etc/init.d/qemu-binfmt start}}

or start the service on bootstrap:
{{RootCmd| rc-update add qemu-binfmt default}}

You could learn more detail of registering bin formats through /usr/portage/app-emulation/qemu-user/files/qemu-binfmt.initd.

===Enter/Exit the Chroot===

Firstly, you should chose and download a stage3 tarball from [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml installation media].
We take arm arch as an example to show how to enter/exit the chroot.

*Download and unpack arm stage tarball
:{{RootCmd|mkdir arm-chroot && cd arm-chroot|wget http:// stage3-armv7a-date.tar.bz2|tar -xvf stage3-armv7a-date.tar.bz2}}
*Install the static qemu-user into the chroot
:{{RootCmd| ROOT{{=}}$PWD/ emerge -K qemu-user}}
*Mount the required directories
:{{RootCmd|mkdir -p usr/portage| mount --bind /usr/portage usr/portage | mount --bind /proc proc | mount --bind /sys sys}}
*Chroot into the environment
:{{RootCmd|chroot . /bin/busybox mdev -s | chroot . /bin/bash --login}}
*Unmount stuff when not in use
:{{RootCmd|umount usr/portage | umount sys | umount proc}}

==Setup Crossdev==
The first thing that is necessary is the creation of an [[overlay]]. If you have one, emerge the script:

{{RootCmd|emerge crossdev}}

This will provide you with the crossdev script. This script automates the steps necessary to build a toolchain. These steps are, in short:

#binutils:  Build a cross-binutils, which links and processes for the target architecture.
#linux-headers:  Install a set of C library and kernel headers for the target architecture.
#libc-headers:  Additional header files
#gcc-stage-1:  Build a basic (stage 1) gcc cross-compiler. This will be used to compile the C library. It will be unable to build anything almost else (because it can't link against the C library it doesn't have).
#libc:  Build the cross-compiled C library (using the stage 1 cross compiler).
#gcc-stage-2:  Build a full (stage 2) C cross-compiler.

All cross toolchains will be kept locally in the [[overlay]], separate from native tools.

{{File|/etc/make.conf||
source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf

PORTDIR_OVERLAY{{=}}"/usr/local/portage $PORTDIR_OVERLAY"
}}

The script is used like:
{{RootCmd|crossdev -t powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu}}

This will build a cross-compiling toolchain for PowerPC machines.

By default, the newest stable version of the binutils, libraries, and C compiler will be used. It is quite often the case they will not compile themselves through the entire build process. Less bleeding edge versions can be specified with additional flags:

 --b 2.22      # specifies the version of binutils
 --g 4.6.3     # specifies the version of gcc
 --l 2.15-r2   # specifies the version of the tuple-specified libc
 --k 3.5       # specifies the version of the kernel headers

It is recommended trying older versions, particularly of gcc, if the script fails.

If you want to remove a toolchain, use the clean flag:

{{RootCmd|crossdev -C powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu}}

This will unmerge the packages created by crossdev.

If you got the errors about fortran, use the fellow command:
{{RootCmd|USE{{=}}"-fortran nossp" crossdev -t powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu}}

== Cross Container ==
The lxc.sh tool can download, configure and create a multi-arch gentoo guest.
Using this tool, the user build a native gcc in chroot.
You can download it here: [https://github.com/jinghuang/cross_container_support lxc.sh]

Next, we will take '''armv7a_hardfloat''' as a example to build the native compiler in chroot.

=== Install a cross compiler ===
You must install the cross compiler manually:

{{RootCmd|USE{{=}}"-fortran nossp" crossdev -t armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi}}

=== Create the chroot ===
You can create an arm gentoo guest:
{{RootCmd|./lxc.sh create -i ''ip_address'' -g ''gateway'' -n ''guest_name'' -r ''rootfs'' -a arm<br />
What is the subarch of arm? armv7a}}

You can also start and destroy the arm gentoo guest:

{{RootCmd|./lxc.sh start -n ''guest_name''}}

{{RootCmd|./lxc.sh destroy -n ''guest_name'' -r ''rootfs''}}

Additional developers, bug fixes, comments, etc. are welcome.

=== Switch to native compiler ===
In chroot, you can switch to native compiler:
{{RootCmd|cd /root}}
{{RootCmd|source switch.sh native}}

Then, you can get the native armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi-gcc.
To use it, just specify the '''CC=armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi-gcc''' in the Makefile.

You also could switch to emulated gcc as well:
{{RootCmd|source switch.sh emu}}
