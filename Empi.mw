== Introduction ==
=== Motivation ===
There are numerous MPI (Message Passing Interface)
implementations in the portage tree, and far more in general.
While it would be nice if everyone could settle on just one,
there are a number of reasons this isn't going to happen anytime
soon. For instance, binary-only applications that rely on a
specific implementation/version, early support for new hardware,
and, of course, developer preference.

The goal of empi is to ease the administrator burden inherent in
managing numerous HPC applications and libraries, each of which
support some subset of the available MPI implementations. Also,
empi strives to ensure that any user of an HPC system can
happily work with their favorite implementation and supporting
applications, while another user may utilize an entirely
different implementation, with potentially overlapping
applications.

If you are only concerned with quickly getting up and running,
you may skip the rest of this section as it only serves to
provide a description of how empi works behind the scenes.

=== Empi ===
Heavily based on <code>sys-devel/crossdev</code>, empi is a
script wrapping portage that uses a small bit of trickery to
emerge MPI implementations and any dependent packages to unique
directories in ''/usr/lib/mpi/''. Quickly explained,
this is done by making a local overlay, creating new categories
that define a set consisting of a single version of one MPI
implementation and any packages that utilize this implementation,
and then using that category to find the correct install
locations. The bulk of the work involving portage is handled by
mpi.eclass.

Empi itself can handle creating the overlay directory structure,
merging definitions in package.use and package.keywords, and
calling emerge for the required packages. The overlay is created
using symlinks, so any update to the portage tree will be
replicated in the empi overlay.

=== mpi.eclass ===

The eclass uses the package category to decide where a package
should be installed inside of ''/usr/lib/mpi/''. Only
packages inheriting this eclass will ever be installed in this
separate root. The advantage over using <code>ROOT=/some/where/
emerge stuff</code> being we only need to install packages that
actually require MPI or are implementations into this separate
root directory, everything else is provided by the standard
system.

Note that it is required that any ebuild will have to be ported
to use mpi.eclass, just inheriting in anything but the simplest
ebuild will not work automatically. Currently autotools based
packages can be ported with minimal effort. Sadly, these are in
the minority in the HPC package space, so mpi.eclass also
provides mechanisms for getting install paths as well as wrappers
around the standard ebuild utilities, do* and new*, with the
prefix mpi_. For instance, if an ebuild needs to call
<code>dobin</code>, it should be ported to use
<code>mpi_dobin</code> instead.

The eclass should be transparent if empi is not being used;
packages can still be emerged normally onto the system without
any trace of mpi.eclass being used. 

=== eselect-mpi ===
Recall that the grand unified goal is to enable users to easily
work with different implementations at the same time on the same
system. Therefore, unlike the majority of the other eselect
modules, <code>eselect-mpi</code> is designed to administer a
users' personal MPI environment. This is done by writing the
required environment variables and other implementation specific
details to ''${HOME}/.env.d/mpi.sh'' and
''${HOME}/.env.d/mpi.csh'' which the user must remember
to source if they plan on utilizing the implementation. For the
curious, all we're really doing is providing the environment
variables such as <code>PATH</code>, <code>MANPATH</code> and
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> in this file.

A user may also use <code>eselect-mpi</code> to unselect an
implementation.  Then, after re-sourcing the appropriate file in
''${HOME}/.env.d/'', their environment is returned to
its previous (empi-less) state and they may continue on with
their work using the system MPI implementation (if installed). 

== Using empi ==
=== Installing empi ===

The above introduction makes a lot more sense once we actually
get some implementations installed and start working with them.
To begin, add the science overlay, which is where empi and the
related ebuilds are currently being maintained. 
{{RootCmd|emerge sys-cluster/empi}}

=== Adding an implementation and packages ===

To get started, we'll add a single implementation based on
sys-cluster/openmpi as well as the sys-cluster/hpl package that
will be built using openmpi and installed into the correct root. 

{{Note|For the duration of this documentation, implementation will be used to refer to a package providing MPI, whereas class will be used to refer to the set of a single implementation and any packages using it.}}

{{RootCmd|/usr/bin/empi --create --class mpi-openmpi {{=}}sys-cluster/openmpi-1.2.6-r1}}

The above says that we want to create a new class, based on
<code>sys-cluster/openmpi-1.2.6-r1</code> and that we're going to
call this class <code>mpi-openmpi</code> from now on. Empi will
happily create the overlay structure in
<code>MPI_OVERLAY_DIR</code>, duplicate anything related to
openmpi in ''package.keywords'' or
''package.use'', and emerge
<code>mpi-openmpi/openmpi-1.2.6-r1</code>. 

{{Important|Class names must always be prefixed with 'mpi-' }}
{{Note|Ebuilds for all implementations are actually symlinks back to the main portage tree.  Therefore, any updates to the main tree will also update the empi overlay}}

Note that empi emerged <code>mpi-openmpi/openmpi-1.2.6-r1</code>
and not <code>sys-cluster/openmpi-1.2.6-r1</code>. By changing
the category, empi is alerting mpi.eclass that it needs to handle
separating this install from the standard system root. This new
package can be manipulated using portage via all the normal
mechanisms. Next, we add sys-cluster/hpl to the mpi-openmpi
class. 

{{RootCmd|/usr/bin/empi --class mpi-openmpi --add sys-cluster/hpl}}

Both openmpi and hpl are now installed in the
''/usr/lib/mpi/mpi-openmpi'' root. However, a user still
needs to actually select this class in order to start using it. 

{{Cmd
|eselect mpi set mpi-openmpi
|eselect mpi list
|output=<pre>
Available MPI classes:
  mpi-openmpi               Enabled
</pre>}}
{{Cmd
|source /etc/profile
|eselect mpi list
|output=<pre>
Available MPI classes:
  mpi-openmpi               Enabled, In Use
</pre>}}
