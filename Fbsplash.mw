'''fbsplash''' is a Gentoo implementation of a bootsplash screen to provide some eye candy during boot up or while working on a terminal without X. It is currently available in portage as {{Package|media-gfx/splashutils}}.

== Installation ==
You can install {{Package|media-gfx/splashutils}} with the following command:
{{Emerge|splashutils}}

To also install the Gentoo themes which are also used on the Live CD/DVD:
{{Emerge|media-gfx/splash-themes-gentoo}}

And more themes with:
{{Emerge|media-gfx/bootsplash-themes}}

The build might fail, because many libraries need to have static libraries to be available at boot time, here is a list of USE flags which could be put into {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} (03/07/2012):
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||<pre>
# for boot-splash
media-libs/freetype static-libs
media-libs/libpng static-libs
media-libs/lcms static-libs
virtual/jpeg static-libs
media-libs/libjpeg static-libs
media-libs/libjpeg-turbo static-libs
media-libs/libmng static-libs
sys-libs/zlib static-libs
app-arch/bzip2 static-libs
</pre>}}

Remember to update the packages after changing the USE flags:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

=== USE Flags ===
{{USEflag|package=media-gfx/splashutils
|hardened++no
|png+yes+yes
|truetype+yes+yes
|mng+yes+yes
|gpm
|fbcondecor++yes
}}

=== Requirements ===
To use a splash image the kernel needs to support [[initramfs]].

==== Kernel ====
Enable framebuffer console decorations:
{{Kernel|Kernel framebuffer configuration|<pre>
Device Drivers ->
    Graphics support ->
        Console display driver support --->
            [*] VGA text console
            [*]   Enable Scrollback Buffer in System RAM
            (64)    Scrollback Buffer Size (in KB)
            <*> Framebuffer Console support
            -*-   Map the console to the primary display device
            [ ]   Framebuffer Console Rotation
            [*]   Support for the Framebuffer Console Decorations
            [ ] Select compiled-in fonts</pre>}}

Enable Keyboard support for framebuffer themes:
{{Kernel|Enabling the Event Interface|<pre>
Device Drivers --->
    Input Device Support --->
        <*> Event Interface</pre>}}

Using either [[radeon]], [[intel]] or [[nouveau]] drivers provides a framebuffer capable device which is well implemented into the operating system. For users with the binary nVidia or AMD driver, there are workarounds using [[uvesafb]] to get frambuffer support.

== Usage ==
General usage screnarios.

=== Themes ===
{{Important|this requires the ''fbcondecor'' USE flag}}
The different themes are stored in {{Path|/etc/splash}} where the folder represents the theme name. To test some of them on the console use:
{{RootCmd|splash_manager -c set --theme{{=}}natural_gentoo --tty{{=}}1}}
This will change the theme on ''tty1'' to ''natural_gentoo''. You can choose any theme in {{Path|/etc/splash}} that matches your current resolution. Now to see the theme go to tty1 by pressing {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|Alt}}+{{Key|F1}}.

If you want to preview a theme in silent mode without reboot, then try
{{RootCmd|splash_manager -c demo -t natural_gentoo -m s --steps{{=}}100}}
{{Note|Don't run this command under X window.}}

For more reference please refer to
{{RootCmd|splash_manager --help}}

=== Genkernel ===
If the initramfs is created using [[genkernel]], the configuration in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} should be changed to the theme used.
{{File|/etc/genkernel.conf||<pre>
# Enable splashutils in early space (initrd). Default is "no".
SPLASH="yes"

# Use this splash theme. If commented out - the "default" name theme is used.
# Also, SPLASH="yes" needs to be enabled for this one to one work.
# This supersedes the "SPLASH_THEME" option of /etc/conf.d/splash (in early space).
SPLASH_THEME="emerge-world"
</pre>}}

Alternatively the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/splash}} could be used to configure the theme, which will be loaded after initramfs.

=== Append ===
To append the theme to an existing initramfs:
{{RootCmd|splash_geninitramfs --verbose --res NxN --append /path/to/initramfsimage theme}}

=== Generate ===
To create a new initramfs for our theme:
{{RootCmd|splash_geninitramfs --verbose --res NxN --generate /boot/initramfs-bootsplash theme}}

=== Copy ===
To create a new initramfs with the content of an existing one to add our theme:
{{RootCmd|splash_geninitramfs --verbose --res NxN --copy /path/to/initramfsdir theme}}

=== Bootloader ===
{{GRUB2|video{{=}}uvesafb:1920x1080-32,mtrr:3,ywrap splash{{=}}verbose,theme:emerge-world}}
This enables the ''verbose'' version of the ''emerge-world'' theme, a full list of parameters can be found in {{Path|/usr/share/doc/splashutils*/kernel_parameters}}. The parameter ''video=1920x1080'' is optional, but will choose the proper resolution for the image.

== Screenshot ==
To make screenshots of the framebuffer console, the tool {{Package|media-gfx/fbgrab}} can be used:
{{Cmd|fbgrab fbscreen.png}}
