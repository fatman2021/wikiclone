VMware Player is is a closed source freeware virtualization solution with a feature set similar to [[VirtualBox]] and [[KVM]].  Its only significant advantage (which is increasing less relevant) is that unlike VirtualBox and KVM, it can emulate a 64-bit guest without virtualization extensions in the processor (VT-x / AMD-V).  Additional features are offered in VMware's enterprise alternative, [[VMware Workstation]] (also installable via Portage).

==Installation==

<code>app-emulation/vmware-player</code> like many binaries is frequently not marked stable, so must be unmasked by running, for example:

{{rootCmd|<nowiki>emerge --autounmask-write =vmware-player-4.0.3.703057 && dispatch-conf && emerge =vmware-player-4.0.3.703057</nowiki>}}

For more information on unmasking such packages, see [[Knowledge Base:Accepting a keyword for a single package]].

As Portage will inform you, it must be configured to use networking:

{{rootCmd|emerge --config vmware-player}}

Some modules from <code>app-emulation/vmware-modules</code> must be loaded (<code>emerge -n portage-utils && qlist -e vmware-modules</code> to view all):

Start VMware services and load modules:

{{rootCmd|/etc/init.d/vmware start}}

Run <code>rc-update add vmware default</code> to optionally have load on boot.

Add user to <code>vmware</code> group:

{{rootCmd|gpasswd -a yourUser vmware}}

The simplest way to have this group applicable is to log out and back in.

Running it:

{{cmd|/opt/vmware/bin/vmplayer}}

==GNOME dependencies==

Despite hard [[RDEPEND]] on <code>gnome-base/libgtop</code>, <code>gnome-base/orbit</code>, & <code>x11-libs/libgksu</code> in recent ebuilds, these dependencies can be removed in an [[overlay]] copy and the application will still install and function.
