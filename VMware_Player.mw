'''VMware Player''' is a closed source freeware virtualization solution with a feature set similar to [[VirtualBox]] and [[KVM]]. Its only significant advantage (which is increasing less relevant) is that unlike VirtualBox and KVM, it can emulate a 64-bit guest without virtualization extensions in the processor (VT-x / AMD-V). Additional features are offered in VMware's enterprise alternative, [[VMware Workstation]] (also installable via Portage).

== Installation ==
{{Package|app-emulation/vmware-player}} like many binaries is frequently not marked stable, so must be unmasked by running, for example:
{{Emerge|params+=--autounmask-write|{{=}}vmware-player-4.0.4.744019-r1}}
{{RootCmd|dispatch-conf}}
{{Emerge|{{=}}vmware-player-4.0.4.744019-r1}}

For more information on unmasking such packages, see [[Knowledge Base:Accepting a keyword for a single package]].

== Configuration ==
As Portage will inform you, it must be configured to use networking:
{{Emerge|params+=--config|vmware-player}}

Some modules from {{Package|app-emulation/vmware-modules}} must be loaded. Start VMware services and load modules:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/vmware start}}

To optionally have load on boot:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add vmware default}}

Add user to ''vmware'' group:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a YOURUSER vmware}}
The simplest way to apply this setting is to log out and back in.

Running it:
{{Cmd|/opt/vmware/bin/vmplayer}}

== GNOME dependencies ==
Despite hard [[RDEPEND]] on {{Package|gnome-base/libgtop}}, {{Package|gnome-base/orbit}}, & {{Package|x11-libs/libgksu}} in recent ebuilds, these dependencies can be removed in a local [[overlay]] copy and the application will still install and function.

==Additional notes==
Increase duration of BIOS boot screen:
{{cmd|<nowiki>echo 'bios.bootdelay = 5000' >> ~/</nowiki>''vmName''<nowiki>/</nowiki>''vmName''<nowiki>.vmx</nowiki>}}
