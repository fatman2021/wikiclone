== Disable Wake On LAN ==
With [[Wikipedia:Wake-on-LAN|Wake On LAN]] your network card stays also after shutdown powered, so it can receive the special packages, which wakes your computer up.

If you don't need WOL disable it. Check with {{Package|sys-apps/ethtool}}, if WOL is already disabled:
{{Emerge|sys-apps/ethtool}}
{{RootCmd|ethtool -s eth0|output=<pre>
Supports Wake-on: g
Wake-on: d
</pre>}}
The ''d'' stands for disabled.

=== BIOS ===
If you have an onboard device, you can most often disable WOL in the [[BIOS]].

=== ethtool ===
Create a [[local.d]] script to disable WOL, e.g.:
{{File|/etc/local.d/start||<pre>
#!/bin/sh
ethtool -s eth0 wol d
</pre>}}

== Throttle Gigabit-Ethernet ==
Gigabit-Ethernet needs more power than Fast-Ethernet. If you don't use the greater bandwidth, you can throttle your connection to Fast-Ethernet. For it install {{Package|sys-apps/ethtool}}:
{{Emerge|sys-apps/ethtool}}

Now you can throttle the connection:
{{RootCmd|ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off speed 100}}

If you want to always throttle the connection, create a [[local.d]] script.
