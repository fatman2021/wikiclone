'''radeon''' is a family of open source graphics drivers for AMD/ATI Radeon graphics cards.

== Hardware detection ==
To choose the right driver, first detect the graphics card. You can use [[Hardware detection#lspci|lspci]] for this task:
{{RootCmd|lspci {{!}} grep -i VGA}}

: 1) Needs testing packages: >=mesa-9.1
: 2) Work in Progress

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to set the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
    [*] MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support
Device Drivers  --->
    Graphics support  --->

        If your card sits in an AGP slot, choose your AGP driver, e.g.:
        <*/M> /dev/agpgart (AGP Support)  --->
            <*/M> AMD Opteron/Athlon64 on-CPU GART support

        <*/M> Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support) --->
            <*/M> ATI Radeon
            [*] Enable modesetting on radeon by default

        -*- Support for frame buffer devices  --->
            < >   ATI Radeon display support
</pre>}}

=== Firmware ===
Microcode is required for R600 and newer GPUs. Install either {{Package|x11-drivers/radeon-ucode}} or {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} (contains also other firmware):
{{Emerge|radeon-ucode}}
{{Emerge|linux-firmware}}

If you compiled radeon directly into the kernel instead of as a module, make sure firmware for your model (check available ones in {{Path|/lib/firmware/radeon}}) is included in kernel:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
        -*- Userspace firmware loading support
        [*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
            (radeon/<YOUR-MODEL>.bin)
            (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
</pre>}}

Below is a list of the firmware files needed for each family of cards:

=== Driver ===
Portage uses the variable '''VIDEO_CARDS''' for enabling support for various graphics cards in packages. Setting '''VIDEO_CARDS''' to e.g. ''radeon'' (see the [[#Feature support|feature matrix]]) will pull in the correct driver:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
VIDEO_CARDS="radeon"
</pre>}}

Check the USE flags of {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati}}:
{{USEflag|package=x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
|glamor+++(For Northern Islands and older cards) Enable Glamor OpenGL 2D acceleration
|glamor++yes+(For Southern Islands and newer cards) Enable Glamor OpenGL 2D acceleration
|udev+yes+yes
}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}

== Configuration ==

=== Permissions ===
{{VIDEO CARDS/Permissions}}

=== xorg.conf ===
The [[X server]] is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit X.Org's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

You can force the X server to use desired driver with:
{{VIDEO CARDS/xorg.conf|radeon}}

== Advanced configuration ==

=== Power Management ===
Power management can be set in the [[sysfs]] filesystem as follows:

* Check the current power method:
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method}}

* Change the power method:
: The "dynpm" method dynamically changes the clocks based on demand. (not effective as of June 27, 2012)
: {{RootCmd|echo "dynpm" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method}}
: The "profile" method lets you set a profile on how the card should behave.
: {{RootCmd|echo "profile" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method}}

* Check the current profile:
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile}}

* Change the profile:
: Options for profile:
:# "default" no change of clock speeds
:# "auto" switches between "mid" and "high" power states based on the whether the system is on battery power or not. The "low" power state are selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.
:# "low" forces the GPU to be in the low power state all the time. Note that "low" can cause display problems on some laptops; this is why auto does not use "low" when displays are active.
:# "mid" forces the GPU to be in the "mid" power state all the time. The "low" power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.
:# "high" forces the GPU to be in the "high" power state all the time. The "low" power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.
: {{RootCmd|echo "low" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile}}

* Check the current GPU, Memory clocks and voltage (needs to have kernel debugfs enabled):
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info}}
: {{Note|With more than one monitor connected, the memory clock will always be on full speed.}}
: {{Note|On APU chipsets, those settings have little to no effect and give inconclusive results.}}

===== Power Management with Linux Kernel >= 3.11 =====
Linux Kernel 3.11 introduces improved power management for some radeon cards, to activate it pass the parameter radeon.dpm=1 to the kernel.

* Check the dynamic power management state
: {{RootCmd|cat /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state}}

* Change the dynamic power management state
: {{RootCmd|echo "performance" > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state}}
: Other valid options include "battery" and "balanced"

In order to verify that the new dynamic power management code is active check radeon_pm_info (see above), it should say something like
: uvd    vclk: 0 dclk: 0
: power level 0    sclk: 25000 mclk: 15000 vddc: 900 vddci: 950

: {{Note|Using the new dynamic power management will  disable the use of the power profiles mentioned above}}

=== Tuning ===
I couldn't find a summary of all options available so feel free to add to this.
{{Warning|There are several options to tweak the radeon driver and some of these might break your desktop, so if you are uncomfortable with the console better stick to default.}}

===== Tuning with mesa from git =====

* Kernel parameters can be just added to the kernel commandline in {{Path|grub.cfg}} or {{Path|grub.conf}}.
* Environment variables could be put into a file like {{Path|/etc/env.d/99radeon}} to have them initialized during boot.
* {{Path|xorg.conf}} parameter are usual in the ''Device'' section for the card.
* A full list of kernel parameters can be found here: [http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature#Linux_kernel_parameters X.Org Wiki - RadeonFeature]
* S3TC compression needed for some applications like most 3D games: {{Package|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}}

::1) supported by Linux kernel 3.11

=== Monitoring ===
[[lm sensors]] can be used to monitor the cards temperature. It uses the I2C interface, which needs to be enabled in the kernel:
{{Kernel|Including radeon firmware|<pre>
Device Drivers --->
    Graphics support --->
        <*> Support for frame buffer devices --->
            <*> ATI Radeon display support 
                [*] DDC/I2C for ATI Radeon support
</pre>}}

=== Audio over HDMI ===
Audio through the HDMI port is available for some cards. Check the [http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature#Feature_Matrix_for_Free_Radeon_Drivers X.Org Wiki - Radeon Feature Matrix] for the model family. A recent 3.x kernel may be needed.

As noted above, HDMI audio must be explicitly enabled using the kernel commandline paramater ''radeon.audio=1''. In addition, [[ALSA]] typically does not use HDMI as the default audio, so one way to force this as the default is to add a config file:
{{File|~/.asoundrc||<pre>
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave.pcm "hdmi"
}
</pre>}}
which may be moved to {{Path|/etc/asound.conf}} to make HDMI audio the system-wide default.


=== Multichannel LPCM ===
If you want to enjoy full 5.1 HDMI sound on your gentoo rig try out anssi's HDMI audio patch as mentioned in the phoronix forums.
<pre>
cd /usr/src/linux
sudo wget http://onse.fi/files/atihdmi5.patch
sudo patch -p1 < atihdmi5.patch
sudo make && sudo make modules_install && sudo make install
</pre>
Check your bootloader config to use the correct kernel and reboot.
