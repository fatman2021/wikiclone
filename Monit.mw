{{Package|app-admin/monit}}[http://mmonit.com/monit/] is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, programs, files, directories and filesystems on a UNIX system. 

== Installation ==
=== Useflags ===

{{USEflag
|package=app-admin/monit
|pam++yes
|ssl++yes
}}

=== Emerge ===
{{emerge|monit}}

== Configuration ==
Config file of monit resides in {{Path|/etc/monitrc}}. And there is a item to specify a config directory. Uncomment if needed.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/monitrc|1=
## It is possible to include additional configuration parts from other files or
## directories.
#
#  include /etc/monit.d/*
#
}}


=== Users ===
Users added to the monit or users group will be able to manipulate monit through the web interface.

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a $USER monit}}
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a $USER users}}

{{warning|passwords can be streamed to monits web interface, disable it all together after it is setup}}

{{important|for security purposes change this entry}}

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/monitrc|allow admin:monit}}

== Boot Services ==
=== inittab ===
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/inittab|title=auto restart monit in case of failure|1=
ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -r now

# Run monit in standard runlevels
mo:2345:respawn:/usr/bin/monit -Ic /etc/monitrc

# Used by /etc/init.d/xdm to control DM startup.
}}

to start monit immediately after changing inittab

{{RootCmd|telinit q}}

=== OpenRC ===
{{note|prefer inittab method over rc services}}
To start the service at boot.
{{RootCmd|rc-update add monit default}}
To start the service immediately.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/monit start}}

==== Monitoring Monit ====
This hourly cron script will check to make sure monit has not crashed.  As this uses pgrep, make sure to not name it monit.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/cron.hourly/moncheck|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/bash
if ! pgrep monit >/dev/null; then
    rc-service monit restart
fi
}}

== Pidfile Check ==
monit relies on the pidfile convention, it can only monitor background daemons. For daemons that do not create a pidfile, [http://mmonit.com/wiki/Monit/FAQ#pidfile a trick] is needed.

pidfile approach is [http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ProcessManagement intrinsically broken] for monitforing process. Monit can overcome this by checking the pidfile frequently enough to be reliable, though.

== Examples ==
=== Auto Restart Mysql ===
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/monitrc|title=auto restart mysql|1=
check process mysql with pidfile /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
    start program = "/bin/bash -c 'rc-service mysql start'"
    stop program  = "/bin/bash -c 'rc-service mysql stop'"
}}

=== Squid Memory Alert ===
{{Package|net-proxy/squid}} is a caching proxy that is memory hungry. It can control its memory consumption by itself in the configuration file, while we can make an redundent check here.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/monitrc|title=check squid|1=
 check process squid with pidfile /run/squid.pid
   start program = "/bin/bash -c 'rc-service squid start'"
   stop  program = "/bin/bash -c 'rc-service squid stop'"
   if totalmem > 30 MB then alert
}}

== CLI Interface ==
We can run monit foreground and see the effect.

{{RootCmd|monit -Ivv|output=<pre>
...
'squid' total mem amount of 30848kB matches resource limit [total mem amount>30720kB]
</pre>}}

== Web Interface ==

Navigate to http://localhost:2812/ & login using your edited configuration line or admin / monit if you have not changed it yet.
