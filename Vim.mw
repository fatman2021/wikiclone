'''Vim''' ('''V'''i '''im'''proved) is a text editor based on [[Wikipedia:Vi|vi]]. It can be used from the command line or as a standalone application with graphical user interface.

== Installation ==
If you want to install Vim with both the ncurses-based interface for the terminal (<code>/usr/bin/vim</code>) and the graphical interface for X (<code>/usr/bin/gvim</code>), just type:
{{Emerge|app-editors/gvim}}

If you are only interested in using Vim in a terminal, type:
{{Emerge|app-editors/vim}}

There is also an experimental [[Qt]] interface called vim-qt, available in the ''qt'' overlay.

=== Extensions ===
The category ''app-vim'' provides a lot of additional syntax definitions, plugins and other Vim related stuff.
{{Emerge|params=--search|"%@^app-vim"}}
{{Cmd|eix -cC app-vim}}

== Getting started ==
Vim has a built-in tutorial which should require around 30 min to go through. Start it using command:
{{Cmd|vimtutor}}

== Modes ==
Vim has 3 modes:
* Command mode: Keystrokes are interpreted as commands
* Insert mode: Keystrokes are interpreted as text (except a few special commands)
* Visual mode: Visual mode supports you by selecting some text. It behaves a lot like command mode

== Tips and Tricks ==

=== Using Vim like ex or ed from the command line ===
Change all startlines from file.txt to startlines with #:
{{Cmd|vim -c ":%s/^}/#}/g" -c ":x" file.txt}}

Change encoding of file to UTF-8:
{{Cmd|vi -c ":wq! ++enc{{=}}utf8" file.txt}}
