= Introduction =
This guide aims at explaining how to read and write in Japanese on a non-Japanese system. Please feel free to amend it based on your own knowledge or experience.

= What is needed ?=
== Japanese fonts ==
If your are not using a Japanese system, you probably have no such fonts installed and if you try to enter Japanes characters from your keyboard, you will only see small rectangle boxes in place of the characters on the screen.
== Input method ==
To read and write in Japanese, the first thing you need is a way to enter Japanese characters with your usual keyboard. This is done via a piece of software usually called an ''input method''. At the moment, for the Japanese language,  there are 2 such common methods : '''anthy''' and '''mozc'''.


With such a software component typing '''ta''' on your keyboard will input the kana '''た''' into your word processor. Some simple manipulation that is relevant to the way your input method works, will permit you to easily switch from the hiragana '''た''' to the katakana  '''タ'''.
In a similar way typing '''nihon''' will input '''にほん''' and an other simple manipulation will permit you to turn this to the kanji version of this word '''日本'''.


{{Note|It is not the purpose of this guide to  describe in details how the anthy or mozc input methods work. Please refer to the documentation of these software components.}}

== IME ==
On top of this you also need a way to switch from the input method you normally use for your own language to the one you need for the Japanese language. This functionality is provided by an other piece of software called an IME for '''I'''nput '''M'''ethod '''E'''ditor such as '''ibus''' or '''SCIM''' . 
Once installed, you will be able to switch from your own language's input method to the Japanese input method using a key combination or using your mouse to select a relevant icon in the icon tray.

= Installing the software components =
== Japanese fonts ==
As a minimum, install the ''media-fonts/kochi-substitute'' package.
{{emerge|  kochi-substitute}}

As extra, are also available:
* media-fonts/ja-ipafonts
* media-fonts/vlgothic
* media-fonts/mplus-outline-fonts
* media-fonts/monafont
* media-fonts/ipamonafont
* media-fonts/sazanami

== Input Method and Input Method Editor ==
=== Installing ===
You are advised to prefer ibus to scim. To install the previous, you need :
==== anthy ====
* app-i18n/anthy
* app-i18n/ibus-anthy
* app-i18n/ibus

Normally installing ibus-anthy should pull in ibus and anthy (if not emerge them separately).
{{emerge|  ibus-anthy}}

===  mozc ===
* app-i18n/mozc
* app-i18n/ibus
{{Note|mozc has better reputation than anthy though anthy has been proving working fine for years now. Among pros for mozc, there are the fact that it shows the candidates instantly during typing and  has a better learning system in order to present the user the best candidates depending on the user's habit and context.}}

{{Note| At the time I am writing this section (July 2014) mozc doesn't work on my Gentoo/Gnome3 system. If you find any reason to this, please tell it.}}

=== Launching the ibus daemon at logging time ===
Add these lines to your {{Path| ~/.xprofile}}  file and reboot.

{{File|~/.xprofile||<pre>export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
ibus-daemon -drx
</pre>}}

=== Configuring ===
To configure the Input Method Editor, use the following command as a standard user

{{cmd|ibus-setup}} 
Alternatively, if you are a gnome user, type ibus in the search bar and launch ibus-preferences.

In the dialog box that appears, click on the ''Input method'' tab and add the ''japanese-anthy'' method. Then return to the ''General'' tab and define a key combination as a keyboard short cut for switching the input method.

== Latex ==
Here are some additional requirements to write Latex files in Japanese
=== ibus-qt ===
When using editor aiming at writing Latex files such as TexMaker or TexStudio, ibus crashes each time you enter a Latex command (specially after entering the '''{''' char.
To solve this kind of malfunctioning you have to install ''ibus-qt''.
{{emerge| emerge ibus-qt}}
=== CJK and xetex support ===
In order to write Japanese chunks in Latex files you need to add support for CJK languages and for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX xetex]] in Texlive.
To do so in the {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} add or modify the following lines :
* app-text/texlive ... cjk xetex ...
* app-text/texlive-core ... cjk xetex ...

Here is a working short sample :

<pre>
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{CJKutf8}
\usepackage{color}

\begin{document}

\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{min}
\section{One simple example}
\textcolor {red}{これは赤いです。}
\\
私は日本語で書けます。
\\
But I can also write with latin characters
\end{CJK}

\end{document}

</pre>
{{Note| In the ''\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{goth}'' command in the example above, {min} defines the font (here Mincho but you could use {goth}, for Gothic, or {maru}, for Maru Gothic, as well. }}

=== Editor configuration ===
{{Warning|At the time of writing this section, I am using a French system, thus I have to translate the menus from French to English. This means that the translation may not match the actual term. If you are using an English system, please, verify the translation, correct it adequately and remove this warning.}}
To compile and visualize the output of the sample above you have to set up some parameters in you Texmaker or Texstudio editor.
Open Texmaker, and go in ''Options'' --> ''Configure Texmaker'', under  the ''Commands'' tab change this :
* At the LaTeX, change ''latex'' with ''platex''. 
* At the line Dvipdfm, change ''divipdfm'' with ''dvipdfmx''.
Then go under the ''Fast compile'' tab and chose ''Latex + Dvipdfm + View PDF''.
Finally go under the ''Editor'' tab, chose UTF8 encoding and uncheck the "On the fly" on the dictionary line.
