When emerging packages it is possible to build them in tmpfs (RAM) space instead of having build files pushed and pulled to Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD) space. Building in tmpfs both speeds up emerge times and reduces HDD/SSD wearing. For system's containing SSDs, it is generally a good idea to have Portage compile using tmpfs (RAM) instead burning up precious SSD write cycles (especially on something like compiling software).

== fstab Configuration ==

Mount Portage's <code>TMPDIR</code> to tmpfs by adding the following to the system's {{Path|/etc/fstab}} config file:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/fstab|title=tmpfs fstab example|1=
tmpfs		/var/tmp/portage		tmpfs	uid=portage,gid=portage,mode=775,size=2048M,noatime	0 0
}}

Adjust the <code>size</code> parameter {{Path|/etc/fstab}} to the desired amount of RAM. Systems with large amounts of RAM can increase the number quite significantly.

After {{Path|/etc/fstab}} has been modified, mount Portage's TMPDIR to RAM by running the <kbd>mount</kbd> command followed by the directory location outline in {{Path|fstab}}:
{{RootCmd|mount /var/tmp/portage}}

== Considering tmpfs' Size ==
The system's tmpfs space should be large enough to handle the largest packages to be compiled on the system. If the tmpfs space were to ever become completely full then the emerge will fail. Most packages do not need more than 1 GB of tmpfs space their compiles, but there are few ''very'' large packages. If you have a lot of RAM, setting  Be careful to include enough tmpfs space when installing the following packages:

{{package|app-office/openoffice}}: 10GBs or so.

{{package|www-client/chromium}}: More than 2GBs.

{{package|sys-devel/gcc}}: More than 4 GiB.

== Per-Package Choices at Compile Time ==
Portage can be configured to build large packages outside of the tmpfs space on a per-package basis.

Create a file to tell Portage where to place the temporary files directory:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/env/notmpfs.conf|1=
PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/var/tmp/notmpfs"
}}

Create a separate temporary file directory outside of the tmpfs mount location:
{{RootCmd|mkdir /var/tmp/notmpfs && chown portage:portage /var/tmp/notmpfs && chmod 775 /var/tmp/notmpfs}}

Create a special Portage file called {{Path|package.env}} in {{Path|/etc/portage}} and list all the packages that are too large to be compiled using tmpfs:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.env|1=
app-office/libreoffice notmpfs.conf
mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird notmpfs.conf
www-client/chromium notmpfs.conf
}}
