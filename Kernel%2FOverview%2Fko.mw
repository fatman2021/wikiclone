이 문서에서는 젠투가 포티지를 통해 제공하는 모든 커널 소스에 대한 개요 정보를 제공합니다.

== 도입부 ==

젠투 리눅스의 나머지 부분과 같이 젠투 커널 팀의 철학은 여러분 사용자들에게 최대한 폭넓은 선택의 자유를 드리는 것입니다. <code>emerge -s sources</code>의 출력을 보시면 꽤 다양한 선택이 가능한 커널 목록을 보실 수 있습니다. 이 문서에서 젠투 설계의 시각에서 각각의 패치셋의 목표를 살펴볼 수 있게 하고, 이밖에도 제공해드릴 수 있는 다른 커널 소스에 대해서도 설명할 것입니다. 

== 지원 커널 꾸러미 ==

=== genkernel ===

<code>Genkernel</code> is a kernel toolset that can be used to autodetect your hardware and configure your kernel automatically. This is usually recommended for users who do not feel comfortable about compiling a kernel manually. 

For more information, please read the [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/genkernel.xml Gentoo Linux Genkernel Guide] . 

=== General purpose: gentoo-sources ===

For most users, we recommend the <code>gentoo-sources</code> kernel. <code>gentoo-sources</code> is a kernel based on Linux 3.x, lightly patched to fix security problems, kernel bugs, and to increase compatibility with the more uncommon system architectures. 

The <code>gentoo-sources</code> package absorbs most of the resources of the Gentoo kernel team. They are brought to you by a group of talented developers, which can count on the expertise of popular kernel hacker Greg Kroah-Hartman, maintainer of udev and responsible for the USB and PCI subsystems of the official Linux kernel. 

=== For servers: hardened-sources ===

<code>hardened-sources</code> is based on the official Linux kernel and is targeted at our users running Gentoo on server systems. It provides patches for the various subprojects of Gentoo Hardened (such as support for[http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/ LSM/SELinux] and[http://grsecurity.net grsecurity] ), together with stability/security-enhancements. Check[http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/ http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/] for more information. 

{{Important|This kernel provides powerful patches for enhanced security. Please read the [http://www.gentoo.org//proj/en/hardened/ documentation] before you use it.}}

=== ck-sources ===

<code>ck-sources</code> is Con Kolivas's kernel patch set. This patchset is primarily designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity and is configurable for varying workloads (from servers to desktops). The patchset includes a different scheduler, BFS, designed to keep systems responsive and smooth even when under heavy load. Support and information is available at[http://kernel.kolivas.org http://kernel.kolivas.org] and in<code>#ck</code> on<code>irc.oftc.net</code> . 

=== git-sources ===

The <code>git-sources</code> package tracks daily snapshots of the upstream development kernel tree. You should run these kernels if you are interested in kernel development or testing. Bugreports should go to the [http://bugzilla.kernel.org/ Linux Kernel Bug Tracker] or LKML (Linux Kernel Mailing List). 

=== Architecture dependent kernels ===

<code>mips-sources</code> and<code>xbox-sources</code> are, as their names suggest, patched to run best on specific architectures. They also contain some of the patches for hardware and features support from the other patch sets mentioned above and below. 

== Unsupported kernel packages ==

Now I'm going to try to briefly describe some of the other {{Path|sys-kernel/*-sources}} which you saw scroll by when you ran <code>emerge -s sources</code> . Let's take them in alphabetical order. These kernels are provided as a courtesy only and the various patch sets are not supported by the Gentoo kernel team. 

=== pf-sources ===

The <code>pf-sources</code> kernel brings together parts of several different kernel patches. It includes the BFS patchset from <code>ck-sources</code> , the <code>tuxonice</code> patches, [http://www.linuximq.net LinuxIMQ] , and the [http://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/patches/ BFQ] I/O [http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Budget_Fair_Queuing_IO_Scheduler scheduler] . 

=== openvz-sources ===

OpenVZ is a server virtualization solution built on Linux. OpenVZ creates isolated, secure virtual private servers (VPSs) or virtual environments on a single physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that applications do not conflict. For more information, see [http://www.openvz.org http://www.openvz.org] . 

=== tuxonice-sources ===

The <code>tuxonice-sources</code> (formerly <code>suspend2-sources</code> ) are patched with both genpatches which includes the patches found in gentoo-sources, and [http://www.tuxonice.net TuxOnIce] which is an improved implementation of suspend-to-disk for the Linux kernel, formerly known as ''suspend2'' . 

This kernel is recommended for laptop users who often rely on being able to suspend their laptop and resume work elsewhere. 

=== usermode-sources ===

<code>usermode-sources</code> are the User Mode Linux kernel patches. This kernel is designed to allow Linux to run within Linux to run within Linux to ... User Mode Linux is intended for testing and virtual server support. For more information about this amazing tribute to the stability and scalability of Linux, see[http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net] . 

For more information on UML and Gentoo, read the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User-mode_Linux/System_testing_with_UML Gentoo UML Guide] . 

=== vanilla-sources ===

The next kernel sources that many of you will probably be familiar with as Linux users are the <code>vanilla-sources</code> . These are the official kernel sources released on [http://www.kernel.org/ http://www.kernel.org/] . Please note that we do not patch these kernels at all - these are purely for people who wish to run a completely unmodified Linux kernel. We recommend that you use <code>gentoo-sources</code> instead. 

Two versions of the kernel can be found under this package: 2.6 and 3.x. 

== Previously provided kernel packages ==

=== aa-sources ===

<code>aa-sources</code> was a heavily modified kernel with all kinds of patches. The upstream maintainer has stopped releasing kernel patchsets, this package was removed as it went out of date. 

=== alpha-sources ===

<code>alpha-sources</code> was a 2.4 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the Alpha architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. Alpha users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== Architecture dependent kernels ===

<code>cell-sources</code> was a 2.6 kernel designed to run on the Sony PlayStation 3 game console. 

=== development-sources ===

<code>development-sources</code> , the official 2.6 kernel from kernel.org, can now be found under the<code>vanilla-sources</code> package. 

=== gentoo-dev-sources ===

<code>gentoo-dev-sources</code> , a 2.6 kernel patched with bug, security and stability fixes, can now be found under the<code>gentoo-sources</code> package. 

=== grsec-sources ===

The <code>grsec-sources</code> kernel source used to be patched with the latest grsecurity updates (grsecurity version 2.0 and up) which included, amongst other security-related patches, support for PaX. As grsecurity patches are included in <code>hardened-sources</code> , this package is no longer in Portage. 

=== hardened-dev-sources ===

<code>hardened-dev-sources</code> can now be found under the<code>hardened-sources</code> package. 

=== hppa-sources ===

<code>hppa-sources</code> was a 2.6 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the HPPA architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. HPPA users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== mm-sources ===

The <code>mm-sources</code> were based on the <code>vanilla-sources</code> and contained Andrew Morton's patch set. They includde the experimental and bleeding-edge features that were going to be included in the official kernel (or that were going to be rejected because they set your box on fire). They were known to be always moving at a fast pace and can change radically from one week to the other; kernel hackers used them as a testing ground for highly experimental new stuff. 

=== rsbac-dev-sources ===

The <code>rsbac-dev-sources</code> kernels can now be found under the <code>rsbac-sources</code> package. 

=== rsbac-sources ===

<code>rsbac-sources</code> was a 2.6-based kernel. It contained patches to use Rule Set Based Access Controls ([http://www.rsbac.org RSBAC] ). It has been removed due to lack of maintainers. Use<code>hardened-sources</code> if you need additional security features. 

=== selinux-sources ===

<code>selinux-sources</code> , a 2.4 kernel including lots of security enhancements, has been obsoleted by security development in the 2.6 tree. SELinux functionality can be found in the<code>hardened-sources</code> package. 

=== sh-sources ===

<code>sh-sources</code> was a 2.6 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the SuperH architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. SuperH users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== sparc-sources ===

<code>sparc-sources</code> was a 2.4 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the SPARC architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. SPARC users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== uclinux-sources ===

The <code>uclinux-sources</code> are meant for CPUs without MMUs as well as embedded devices. For more information, see [http://www.uclinux.org http://www.uclinux.org] . Lack of security patches as well as hardware to test on were the reasons this is no longer in the tree. 

=== win4lin-sources ===

<code>win4lin-sources</code> were patched to support the userland win4lin tools that allow Linux users to run many Microsoft Windows (TM) applications at almost native speeds. This was removed due to security issues. 

=== xen-sources ===

<code>xen-sources</code> was a 2.6-based kernel that allowed running multiple operating systems on a single physical system. You can create virtual environments in which one or more guest operating systems run on a[http://www.xensource.com Xen] -powered host operating system. 

The <code>xen-sources</code> patches were incorporated into the mainline Linux kernel as of version 3.0. 

For more information on Xen and Gentoo, read the [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/xen-guide.xml Gentoo Xen Guide] . 

=== zen-sources ===

<code>zen-sources</code> was designed for desktop systems. It included code not found in the mainline kernel. The zen kernel had patches that added new features, supported additional hardware, and contained various tweaks for desktops.
