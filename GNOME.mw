'''GNOME''' is a feature-rich desktop provided by the [http://www.gnome.org GNOME Project]. It is one of the most widely-used desktops for Linux. It has been an important part of Gentoo for many years. Currently the GNOME 2 series is marked stable in Gentoo, and the GNOME 3 series is still marked as testing. Thus, "emerge gnome" on a stable system installs GNOME 2, while the same command will emerge GNOME 3 if you have "~" in your [[ACCEPT_KEYWORDS]] statement in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.

Because it is so rich, "emerge gnome" requires a long time to complete. It installs a large collection of applications.

See [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gnome-config.xml the GNOME Configuration HOWTO] for more information on installing and using GNOME.

==GNOME 2==
GNOME2 is a 2D desktop with 3D extensions.

==GNOME 3==
GNOME 3 is considered by many to be a radical departure. It needs 3D graphics capability by default, but will run in a software rendering mode if the hardware does not support 3D. 

==== Regional Format and Localization ====
The display format of Dates, Times, Number, Currency and Measurement Unit can be changed according to your region via ''System Settings -> Region & Language -> Formats''. 
{{Note|You can only add (+ Button) and select the regions for which you have '''generated locales''' on your system. For more information on generating locales read [[Localization/HOWTO#Generating_Specific_Locales]]}}
