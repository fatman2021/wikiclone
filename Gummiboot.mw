The {{Package|sys-boot/gummiboot}} package is a simple UEFI boot manager, capable of booting Linux and Windows in EFI mode.

== Installation ==

The installation of gummiboot consists out of the following steps:

# Installing the gummiboot package.
# Preparing the EFI system partition.
# Installing the gummiboot UEFI boot manager.

=== Package installation ===

For the moment, {{Package|sys-boot/gummiboot}} is still in ~arch so needs to be added to the {{Path|/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}} first:

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
|echo "sys-boot/gummiboot" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/efi}}

Next, install the {{Package|sys-boot/gummiboot}} package:

{{Emerge|sys-boot/gummiboot}}

=== EFI system partition ===

Make sure that an EFI system partition is available on the system. This is a GPT partition on the disk that is marked as EF00 (EFI System partition).

For instance, with {{Package|sys-apps/gptfdisk}}:

{{RootCmd|gdisk /dev/sda|output=<pre>
Command (? for help): n
Partition number (1-128, default 1): 1
First sector: (enter desired start sector and size, 100 MB should be plenty)
Command (? for help): t
Partition number (1-2): 1
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): EF00
Command (? for help): w
</pre>}}

The file system on this partition must be FAT32:

{{RootCmd|mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sda1}}

Mount this location on the system ({{Path|/boot}} works just fine) and create the {{Path|/boot/EFI/boot}} location.

{{RootCmd|mount /dev/sda1 /boot
|mkdir -p /boot/EFI/boot}}

=== gummiboot UEFI boot manager ===

The '''gummiboot''' application makes the installation, which only needs to be performed once (unless a new version of gummiboot needs to be installed), fairly simple. However, 
* make sure that the system is booted with EFI to start with (either from a EFI compatible media, or through the Linux kernel with EFI stub support) as it will otherwise fail to install, and
* make sure that the EFI variable file system (efivars) is mounted: {{RootCmd|mount -t efivarfs efivarfs /sys/firmware/efi/efivars}}

Then perform the install itself:

{{RootCmd|gummiboot --path /boot install}}

The installation will install the proper EFI files so that the EFI-capable system will boot the gummiboot bootloader.

== Configuration ==

For each operating system, a boot loader entry file needs to be created.

Next to the boot loader entries, a small default configuration file can be created as well.

=== Default configuration entries ===

In {{Path|./loader}} a file called {{Path|loader.conf}} can be created which contains at most the following two entries:
* A ''default'' entry, specifying which operating system entry to boot as default
* A ''timeout'' entry, specifying the number of seconds to wait before the default boot entry is loaded

For instance, this would look like so:

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/loader/loader.conf|title=Default gummiboot settings|1=
default gentoo
timeout 3
}}

The name of the ''default'' entry is the name of the configuration entry file, as created in the next section, without the {{Path|.conf}} suffix.

=== Operating system configuration entries ===

These entry files need to be located on the EFI system partition, in the {{Path|./loader/entries}} location. So if the EFI system partition is mounted at {{Path|/boot}} then this is at {{Path|/boot/loader/entries}}. The following is an example configuration entry named "gentoo":

{{FileBox|filename=./loader/entries/gentoo.conf|title=Gentoo gummiboot configuration entry|1=
title Gentoo Linux
linux /vmlinuz
options root=/dev/sda3
}}

The ''linux'' entry points to an [[EFI_stub_kernel|EFI stub Linux kernel]] file, installed on the EFI system partition.

== Using gummiboot ==

Although the [[EFI_stub_kernel|EFI stub kernel]] configuration works fine, it has the downside that
* new Linux kernels are somewhat risky to test out, as only a single kernel is booted
* adding boot options requires rebuilding the Linux kernel

With gummiboot, additional entries can be configured for new Linux kernel tests, and additional boot options are easy to add to the configuration entry file, or even at boot time.

=== One-time boot loader options ===

In order to boot the system with a particular boot option, in the gummiboot screen, press {{Key|e}} to edit the options.

The changes made in the gummiboot screen are ''not'' preserved!
