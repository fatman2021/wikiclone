[[File:3dconnexion_space_navigator_1024x1024.jpg|300px|thumb|right|SpaceNavigator device]]
This article is written for the SpaceNavigator but it should work with other 3D mouse in the Space-series produced by 3Dconnexion. Only applications that support 3D mouse device can work properly with this driver. For now, only blender support it in the portage tree.

== Kernel configuration ==
To be able to use spacenavd used in this article you need to compile your kernel with input evdev support
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers -> 
   Input Device support -> 
      <*>   Event interface
</pre>}}

== Pitfalls ==
The following troubles are rather easy to run into (and to get out of).

=== No response ===
The device cannot be managed by ''both'' Xorg and the spacenavd daemon
at the same time, see [[#Modes of operation|modes of operation]].
If you get no reaction with Xorg verify that spacenavd is ''not'' running.
Respectively, if the device doesn't work in Blender make sure the daemon
''is'' running and xinput is ''not'' listing the device.

=== Orientation / inverted axes ===
The place where the cable leaves the body marks the top orientation of
the device as with a normal 2D mouse.  If you position the device in a
different position inverting certain axes may be necessary to obtain
expected behavior.

== Modes of operation ==
SpaceNavigator can be operated in two mutually exclusive modes:
# [[#Xorg xinput device|as a 2D mouse controlled by Xorg]]
# [[#Supported applications|as a 3D mouse controlled by a particular application]], e.g. Blender

== Xorg xinput device ==
You can use your SpaceNavigator as a mouse without any additional drivers except for [[#Kernel configuration|Kernel Event Support]] and xf86-input-evdev with

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-spacenavigator.conf ||<pre>
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "evdev 3Dconnexion"
        MatchProduct "3Dconnexion|SpaceNavigator|Space Navigator"
        Driver "evdev"

        Option "ConstantDeceleration" "20"  # decrease initial velocity to usable value
EndSection
</pre>}}

Once you restart Xorg and unplug-replug the device you can list supported properties and current values:

{{Emerge|x11-apps/xinput}}
{{Cmd|xinput --list-props '3Dconnexion Space Navigator'|output=<pre>
Device '3Dconnexion Space Navigator':
        Device Enabled (132):
        Coordinate Transformation Matrix (134):        1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000

        Evdev Wheel Emulation Button (271):        4
        Evdev Drag Lock Buttons (272):        0
</pre>}}

These keys can be used to alter the current configuration, for example:

{{Cmd
|xinput --set-prop '3Dconnexion Space Navigator' 'Device Accel Constant Deceleration' 10
|xinput --set-prop '3Dconnexion Space Navigator' 'Evdev Axis Inversion' 1 1
}}

== Supported applications ==

=== Blender ===
To enable SpaceNavigator support for Blender you need to enable use flag "3dmouse"

{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||<pre>
media-gfx/blender 3dmouse
</pre>}}
or
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use/media-gfx-blender||<pre>
media-gfx/blender 3dmouse
</pre>}}

== spacenavd ==
To get 3D mouse working properly you will need spacenavd.
{{Emerge|app-misc/spacenavd}}

After installing spacenavd you could check out the following file before starting anything, normally default values works for everyone.

{{File|/etc/spnavrc||<pre>
# This is an example configuration file for spacenavd. Uncomment and change
# any settings you need and copy it to /etc/spnavrc.
#
# Note that it's much easier to configure sensitivities and figure out axis
# reversals by using the interactive configure utility "spnavcfg", which lets
# you fiddle with all the settings and see the result immediately.
#
# Lines that start with a `#' are comments, and are ignored by spacenavd.

# Sensitivity is multiplied with every motion (1.0 normal).
#sensitivity = 1.0

# Separate sensitivity for rotation and translation.
#sensitivity-translation = 1.0
#sensitivity-rotation = 1.0

# Dead zone; any motion less than this number is discarded as noise.
#dead-zone = 2

# Selectively invert translation and rotation axes. Valid values are
# combinations of the letters x, y, and z.
#invert-rot = yz
#invert-trans = yz

# Swap Y and Z axes
#swap-yz = false

# Serial device
# Set this only if you have a serial device, and make sure you specify the
# correct device file. If you do set this option, any USB devices will be
# ignored!
#serial = /dev/ttyS0

# Enable/disable LED light (for devices that have one).
#led = on
</pre>}}

When finished you can start the spacenavd with
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/spacenavd start}}

And add it to start up as default with
{{RootCmd|/sbin/rc-update add spacenavd default}}

You could also make [[udev]] start the daemon for you when a SpaceNavigator is plugged in:
{{RootCmd|ln -s 99-space-navigator.rules.ignored /etc/udev/rules.d/99-space-navigator.rules}}

If everything worked correctly you should now have a working device in blender ('''it must be emerge with 3dmouse useflag''').

=== Alternative x11 events ===
By default, the spacenavd daemon use the uevent mechanism but can alternatively use x11 socket to handle events. Most of the time, uevents should be enough to use the 3D mouse in supported applications but Xevents has one advantage, it's capable of handle proprietary driver protocol Magellan. But if your application doesn't run on top of X proprietary driver is useless. More information on ''What's wrong with the proprietary driver ?'' or ''What is provided by the spacenav project?'', read the official FAQ (see links following).

If you want to use X events support, you must enable it with the X use flag on build time and the spacenavd daemon must be notified of this new protocol with
{{RootCmd | spnavd_ctl x11 start }}

To start generating Spacenav X events by default you should add this command in your user startup scripts such as ~/.gnomerc or ~/.xinitrc .

{{Note|Those protocols aren't exclusive, both protocols can be build together, programs that choose to use the X11 protocol, are automatically compatible with either the free spacenavd driver or the proprietary driver.}}

=== Extra ===
Optionally you can add the following ebuild to configure dynamically the spacenavd.
{{Emerge|x11-misc/spnavcfg}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/spacenavd start}}
{{Cmd|spnavcfg}}

[[File:spnavcfg.png|frame|Configuration GUI "spnavcfg"]]

The changes are immediately transmit to the spacenavd daemon that modify its behavior as requested.

{{Note| More information on the daemon could be find in the log file '''/var/log/spnavd.log'''.}}
