'''MPD''' ('''M'''usic '''P'''layer '''D'''aemon) is a flexible, powerful, server-side application for playing music. Through plugins and libraries it can play a variety of sound files while being controlled by its network protocol. For more information, read about [http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/What_MPD_Is_and_Is_Not what mpd is and is not].

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|media-sound/mpd}}. Following minimal USE flags set is needed to be able to play most known audio file formats, and to listen to audio streams. For more features review the USE flags. 
{{USEflag
|package=media-sound/mpd
|alsa+yes+yes
|curl+yes+yes
|flac++yes
|id3tag+yes+yes
|mad+yes+yes
|ogg++yes
|unicode++yes
|vorbis++yes
|wavpack++yes
}}
Note that a number of these flags are added by the desktop profile.
{{Emerge|mpd}}

== Configuration ==
After finished installation MPD should be working with the gentoo shipped default configuration. 

=== Basic configuration ===
Below a example of a simple configuration:
{{File|/etc/mpd.conf||<pre>
 music_directory      "/var/lib/mpd/music"
 playlist_directory   "/var/lib/mpd/playlists"
 db_file              "/var/lib/mpd/database"
 log_file             "/var/lib/mpd/log"
 state_file           "/var/lib/mpd/state"

 user                 "mpd"

 bind_to_address      "localhost"
 bind_to_address      "/var/lib/mpd/socket"

 input {
        plugin "curl"
 }
</pre>}}
At this point MPD should be able to run as a system daemon with its own user called ''mpd'', which is the default setting of MPD.

=== Service ===
You can now start MPD:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/mpd start}}

To start MPD at boot time, add it your default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add mpd default}}

=== PulseAudio (optional) ===
If MPD was build with [[PulseAudio]] support (''pulseaudio'' USE flag), add a dedicated ''audio_output'' section to your {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/mpd.conf||<pre>
 audio_output {
        type            "pulse"
        name            "Pulse Output"
        mixer_control   "Master"
 }
</pre>}}

{{Note|It may be a good practice to [[#Running as a specific user|run both PulseAudio and MPD under X11 user instead]].}}

=== Built-in HTTP streaming server (optional) ===
If MPD was build with ''network'' USE flag, add a dedicated ''audio_output'' section to your {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/mpd.conf||<pre>
 audio_output {    
 	type		"httpd"    
 	name		"HTTP Stream"    
 	encoder		"vorbis"                # optional, vorbis(OGG) or lame(MP3)
 	port		"8000"      
 	bitrate		"192"			# do not define if quality is defined      
 	format		"44100:16:1"    
 }

bind_to_address "0.0.0.0"
</pre>}}
Replace ''localhost'' with ''0.0.0.0'' or a specific interface IP.
Bind to address ''0.0.0.0'' means here: stream on all local found IP interfaces. 
You could change it to a specific interface IP address like f.e. ''192.168.1.2'' then the streaming server is bound to that interface IP only. 

{{Note| Some players require to specify the file format in the URL to be able to connect to the stream. Example: <tt><nowiki>http://192.168.1.2:8000/mpd.ogg</nowiki></tt>}}

=== Running as a specific user (optional) ===
[[#PulseAudio|Sometimes]] it may be handy to run MPD as a specific user.

Start with copying {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}} to {{Path|~/.mpdconf}}. There are some changes that you will have to change in order to run MPD as a user, most importantly ''user'' and ''group'', also make sure the various path settings are correct:
{{File|~/.mpdconf|user definition|<pre>
  user    "YOUR_USER"
  group   "YOUR_USER"
</pre>}}
Make sure your user has read access to the directory you specify in ''music_directory''.
{{Note|If your [[cron]] program supports ''@reboot'' you can create a cronjob that has /usr/bin/mpd start at boot in place of the init script.}}

=== Bluetooth Headset (optional) ===
Setup your Bluetooth headset first, according to [[Bluetooth_Headset|this wiki]]. To be able to switch between the Bluetooth headset and the default sound card, add these lines to the ''audio_output'' section in {{Path|/etc/mpd.conf}}:
{{File|/etc/mpd.conf||<pre>
 audio_output {
        type            "alsa"
        name            "My ALSA Device"
 }
 audio_output {
	type		"alsa"
	name		"ALSA Bluetooth Headset"
	device		"bluetooth"
</pre>}}
