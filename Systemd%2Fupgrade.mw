This page only lists changes, which you need to consider before updating or will break your system. For all changes, see [[#See also|sys-apps/systemd's changelog]] or [[#External resources|upstream's NEWS file]].

== systemd 203 ==
The compatibility symlinks {{Path|/bin/systemctl}} and {{Path|/bin/systemd}} pointing to  {{Path|/usr/lib/systemd/systemd}} are deprecated. The ebuild checks whether your system was booted using compatibility symlinks and refuses to build the new version of systemd.

To upgrade systemd update your [[bootloader]] to use ''init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd'' and reboot the system.

== systemd 200 ==
See the [[udev/upgrade#udev 200|udev upgrade]] article.

== systemd 187 ==
{{Path|graphical.target}} now depends on the {{Path|display-manager.service}} for starting a display manager like GDM, KDM, etc. . So you have to create a new .service file, e.g. for KDM:
{{File|/etc/systemd/system/kdm.service||<pre>
[Unit]
Description=KDM Display Manager
Conflicts=getty@tty1.service
After=systemd-user-sessions.service getty@tty1.service plymouth-quit.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/kdm -nodaemon
Restart=always
IgnoreSIGPIPE=no

[Install]
Alias=display-manager.service
</pre>}}

Now enable the new service, e.g. for KDM:
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable kdm.service}}

Afterwards starting KDM with systemd >=187 should work and you can disable and delete the old .service file (e.g. {{Path|kdm@.service}}).

For the rationale and more informations see the [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/DisplayManagerRework Fedora 18 feature "Display Manager Infrastructure Rework"].
