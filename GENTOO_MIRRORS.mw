'''The GENTOO_MIRRORS variable - in /etc/portage/make.conf - contains a space-delimited list of mirror hosts that Portage should use to download source code.'''

A list of [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml Gentoo mirrors] is maintained on the Gentoo site.

== Choosing a mirror ==
A good mirror can make Portage download source code faster. Usually, you can choose a mirror that is near you.

A tool called [[mirrorselect|mirrorselect]] is available in the Portage tree, and it can help you choose a fast mirror. To automatically select the best five and automatically update /etc/portage/make.conf, you might use the following:
{{Cmd|mirrorselect -s5}}
Alternatively, to interactively choose the mirrors and, again, automatically update your GENTOO_MIRRORS variable you might run:
{{Cmd|mirrorselect -i -o}}
