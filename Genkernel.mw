'''genkernel''' is used to automate the build process of the [[kernel]] and [[initramfs]]. Some of the general features:
* configure the kernel sources
* build bzImage and copy to {{Path|/boot}}
* create initramfs and copy to {{Path|/boot}}
* create symlinks in {{Path|/boot}}
* add custom content to initramfs for encryption, splash images, extra modules etc.
* compress initramfs
* configure the [[bootloader]]

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-kernel/genkernel
|crypt++no
|cryptsetup++no
|ibm++no
|selinux++no
}}

{{Emerge|genkernel}}

== Configuration ==
The actual behavior of genkernel depends on  a large variety of flags that can be set/unset in the   {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} file. This file is very well documented but let's examine some of the most commonly used ones here. For a more complete explanation, please refer to the comments in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} itself or to the output of the <code>man genkernel</code> command.<br />

{{Note|Some of the flags have a variant that triggers a converse behavior. They are figured as '''--[no]flag_name''', and the converse effect is shown in square brakets as in the following example:<br />
'''--[no]-menuconfig''': Activates [deactivates] ... }}<br />

=== Flags acting on user interactivity ===
The configuration flags listed below  help you decide how you will interact with the configuration process. You can even choose whether or not the configuration file created in the process should be saved. The following are the primary configuration flags:

:* '''--[no-]menuconfig''': Activates [ or deactivates] the <code>make menuconfig</code> command (which invokes un interactive configuration menu) before building the kernel.
:* '''--gconfig''': Provides a kernel configuration utility which depends on the GTK+ libraries. The advantage of this option is that most users find it easier and clearer to configure the kernel using this tool, since it relies on the X-windowing system. The disadvantage of this option is that you need the X-windowing system to use it, so it will not work on the command line.
:* '''--xconfig''': Provides a kernel configuration utility which depends on the QT libraries. The advantage of this option is that most users find it easier and clearer to configure the kernel using this tool, since it relies on the X-windowing system. The disadvantage of this option is that you need the X-windowing system to use it, so it will not work on the command line.
:* '''--[no-]save-config''': Saves [or does not save] the kernel configuration to a file in the /etc/kernels/ directory for later use.
:* '''--kernname=NickName''': Allows you to modify the name of the kernel and initrd images in the /boot/ directory, so that the images produced are kernel-NickName-version and initramfs-NickName-version.

=== Flags acting on the resulting system ===
The configuration flags listed here defines which features will, or won't be enabled in the resulting kernel and initrd. 
:* '''--[no-]splash''': Activates [or deactivates] support for [http://fbsplash.berlios.de/wiki/doku.php framebuffer splash] support in the genkernel-built initrd image. To override the default theme used by fbsplash, use '''--splash=PreferredTheme''' (where PreferredTheme is the title of one of the directories inside the /etc/splash/ directory.
:* '''--splash-res=PreferredResolution''': This flag allows you to select which splash screen resolutions will be supported in the initrd during the start-up of the system. This is useful for two reasons: First, you are able to select only the splash screen resolution(s) relevant to your system. Second, you avoid the unnecessary increase in the disk space required by initrd (since the initrd does not have to support resolutions that are irrelevant for your system configuration.) However, you may want to omit this flag if the kernel is being compiled for an Installation CD; this allows splash support for all possible resolutions.
:* '''--do-keymap-auto''': Force keymap selection during the boot sequence.
:* '''--lvm''': Includes support for storage using via [http://sources.redhat.com/lvm2/ Logical Volume Management] (LVM2) from static binaries, if available to the system. Relevant (static) LVM2 binaries are compiled if they are unavailable. Be sure to install the lvm2 package on your system with emerge lvm2 before enabling this flag, and review the [[LVM | LVM article]] on the Gentoo wiki.
:* '''--dmraid''': Includes support for DMRAID; the utility which creates RAID mappings using the kernel device-mapper subsystem. [http://people.redhat.com/~heinzm/sw/dmraid/readme DMRAID] discovers, activates, deactivates and displays properties of software RAID sets (ATARAID, for example) and contained DOS partitions.
:* '''--luks''': Includes support for Linux Unified Key Setup or [http://clemens.endorphin.org/cryptography LUKS]. This will allow you to use a device encrypted by LUKS which contains the root filesystem. On the bootloader, you then set that encrypted device as the value of crypt_root (and real_root shall be the unencrypted device LUKS creates).
:* '''--disklabel''': Adds support for disk label and UUID support to your initrd.
:* '''--iscsi''': Adds support for iSCSI to your initrd.
:* '''--multipath''': Adds support for [[Multipath]] to your initrd.
:* '''--linuxrc=/path/to/your/linuxrc'''': Specifies a user-created linuxrc — a script that is initialized during the start-up stage of the kernel, prior to the actual boot process. (A default linuxrc script should be in the /usr/share/genkernel/ directory.) This script allows you to boot into a small, modularized kernel and load the drivers that are needed (as modules) by the system.
:* '''--cachedir=/path/to/alt/dir/''': Overrides the default cache location used while compiling the kernel.
:* '''--tempdir=/path/to/new/tempdir/''': Specifies the location of the temporary directory used by genkernel while compiling the kernel.
:* '''--unionfs''': Includes support for the [http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-unionfs.html Unification File System] in the initrd image.
:* '''--mountboot''': Detects whether or not the /boot/ directory needs to be mounted on a separate partition. It will check /etc/fstab script for instructions on how to mount the boot partition on a file system (if needed).

=== Flags acting on the tools used for building ===
The following flags are supported by genkernel, and are passed to the relevant applications while the kernel is being assembled. These flags affect the compiling tools used for the kernel compilation process, albeit at a much lower level.

:* '''--kernel-cc=someCompiler''': Specifies the compiler employed during the kernel compilation process.
:* '''--kernel-ld=someLinker''': Specifies the linker employed during the kernel compilation process.
:* '''--kernel-as=someAssembler''': Specifies the assembler employed during the kernel compilation process.
:* '''--kernel-make=someMake''': Specifies an alternative to the GNU make utility employed during the kernel compilation process.
:* '''--utils-cc=someCompiler''': Specifies the compiler employed during the compilation of support utilities.
:* '''--utils-ld=someLinker''': Specifies the linker employed during the compilation of support utilities.
:* '''--utils-as=someAssembler''': Specifies the assembler employed during the compilation of support utilities.
:* '''--utils-make=someMake''': Specifies an alternative to the GNU make utility employed during the compilation of support utilities.
:* '''--makeopts=-jX''': Specifies the number of concurrent threads that the make utility can implement while the kernel (and utilities) are being compiled. The variable 'X' is a number obtained by adding one (1) to the number of CPUs used by the system. So, for a system with one CPU, the appropriate flag is -j2; a system with two CPUs will use the -j3 flag, and so on. (A system with one processor that supports Hyper-Threading™ (HT) Technology can use the -j3 flag, provided Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) support is enabled in the kernel.)


=== Flags acting on the compilation process ===
The following flags usually take effect during the actual compilation:

:* '''--kerneldir=/path/to/sources/''': Specifies an alternative kernel source location, rather than the default /usr/src/linux/ location.
:* '''--kernel-config=/path/to/config-file''': Specifies what alternative kernel configuration will be used, rather than the default /path/to/sources/.config file.
:* '''--module-prefix=/path/to/prefix-directory/''': Specifies a prefix to the directory where kernel modules will be installed (default path is the /lib/modules/ directory.)
:- '''--no-clean''': Activates [or deactivates] the make clean command before compiling your kernel. The make clean command removes all object files and dependencies from the kernel's source tree.
:* '''--no-mrproper''': Activates [or deactivates] the make mrproper command before kernel compilation. Like the make clean command, make mrproper removes all object files and dependencies from the kernel's source tree. However, any previous configuration files (in /path/to/sources/.config or /path/to/sources/.config.old) will also be purged from the kernel's source tree.
:* '''--oldconfig''': Issues the make oldconfig command, which attempts to collect configuration information for the system's architecture from a generic script in /usr/share/genkernel/. This is a non-interactive process; no user input is entertained. Also, if --oldconfig is used in conjunction with --clean, the latter flag is negated, resulting in the activation of the --no-clean flag.
:* '''--callback="echo hello"''': Calls the specified arguments (echo hello, in this case) after the kernel and the relevant modules have been built, but before building the initrd image. This may be useful if you want to install external modules in the initrd image by emerging the relevant item(s) with the callback feature, and then redefining a genkernel module group.
:* '''--no-install''': Activates [or deactivates] the make install command, which installs your new kernel image, configuration file, initrd image and system map onto your mounted boot partition. Any compiled modules will be installed as well.
:* '''--no-ramdisk-modules''': Refrains from copying any modules to the genkernel-created initrd image. This flag is an exception to the rule about the no- prefix; omission of this prefix creates an invalid genkernel flag.
:* '''--all-ramdisk-modules''': Copies all available modules to the genkernel-created initrd image.
:* '''--genzimage''': Creates the initrd image, prior to the kernel image. (This hack currently applies only to PPC Pegasos systems.)
