{{Lowercase title}}
''synaptics'' is the open source input driver for Synaptics and ALPS touchpads.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Input device support  --->
        <*>   Event interface
        [*]   Mice  --->
              <*>   PS/2 mouse
</pre>}}

=== Driver ===
{{INPUT_DEVICES|synaptics evdev}}

== Configuration ==
The driver has alot options to tune it to your needs. See the ''synaptics'' [[man page]] for more information.

=== Fixed Configuration ===
As an example you can enable an option to configure the driver also at runtime. To do so you have to change your [[xorg.conf]]:
{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf/99-synaptics||
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "All touchpads"
        Option SHMConfig "on"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
EndSection
}}

My ([[User:666threesixes666|666threesixes666]] ([[User talk:666threesixes666|talk]])) system doesnt have an xorg.conf.

{{RootCmd|mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d}}

then set any options you want into {{path|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf}}

{{File|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf||
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad catchall"
        Driver "synaptics"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Option "VertEdgeScroll" "on"
        Option      "CircularScrolling"         "on"
        Option      "VertScrollDelta"          "-111"
        Option      "HorizScrollDelta"         "-111"
        Option      "TapButton1"       	          "1"
EndSection
}}

=== Configuration at runtime ===
You need to enable above option to be able to configure the driver also at runtime. Changes at runtime will be lost with the next start of the X-server. To keep them, add them to the above config file.

You can configure the driver with the program ''<code>synclient</code>''. Some examples:
* List all parameters:
: {{Cmd|synclient -l}}
* Cut the right side of the touch area to expand the vertical scroll area:
: {{Cmd|synclient RightEdge{{=}}5000}}
* Finding the right edge parameter:
: {{Cmd|synclient -m 50}}
* Disable the mouse click function:
: {{Cmd|synclient MaxTapTime{{=}}0}}
* Finally, You can dump Your handpicked configuration to the <code>99-synaptics</code> file pasting output of the following command inside the <code>InputClass</code> section:
: {{Cmd|synclient -l {{!}} sed -e '1d' -e 's/^ \+/Option\t"/g' -e 's/ \+{{=}} /"\t"/g' -e 's/$/"/g'}}

Alternatively there is the [[KDE]] systemsettings module {{Package|kde-misc/synaptiks}}:
{{Emerge|synaptiks}}
