{{Metadata|abstract=Distcc is a program designed to distribute compiling tasks across a network to participating hosts. It is comprised of a server, distccd, and a client program, distcc. Distcc can work transparently with ccache, Portage, and Automake with a little setup.}}

[https://code.google.com/p/distcc/ Distcc] 是一个被设计用来将编译任务发布到网络上特定主机的程序。 它由一个服务器<tt>distccd</tt>和一个客户端 <tt>distcc</tt>程序组成. Distcc 可以很好的与[http://ccache.samba.org ccache], [[Portage]]协同工作,只需少量配置就能实现自动化。 

如果打算使用 <tt>distcc</tt> 来安装Gentoo系统，确保先阅读[[#Using_distcc_to_bootstrap|Using distcc to bootstrap]]. 

== Setup ==

=== Dependencies ===

In order to use <tt>distcc</tt>, all of the computers on the network need to have the same GCC versions. For example, mixing 3.3.x (where the x varies) is okay, but mixing 3.3.x with 3.2.x may result in compilation errors or runtime errors. 

=== Installing distcc ===

Distcc ships with a graphical monitor to monitor tasks that a computer is sending away for compilation. This monitor is enabled when the <code>gtk</code> <code>USE</code> flag is set.

After configuring the <code>USE</code> setting, install the {{Package|sys-devel/distcc}} package:

{{Emerge|distcc}}

{{Important|Remember to install {{Package|sys-devel/distcc}} on all of the participating machines.}}

=== Setting up Portage to use distcc ===

Setting up [[Portage]] to use <tt>distcc</tt> is easy. Execute the following steps on each system that should participate in the distributed compiling.

First, make sure that {{Package|sys-devel/distcc}} is installed:

{{Emerge|distcc}}

Next, set the <code>MAKEOPTS</code> variable and <code>FEATURES</code> variable as shown below.
A common strategy is to set <code>N</code> to ''twice'' the number of ''total'' (local + remote) CPU cores + 1 and <code>M</code> as number of ''local'' CPU cores. In case participating hosts are not available, or when the ebuild that is being installed requires a local-only compile (e.g. gcc), then the <code>-lM</code> flag will prevent the spawning of too many tasks.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Setting MAKEOPTS and FEATURES|lang=bash|1=
MAKEOPTS="-jN -lM"
FEATURES="distcc"
}}

For instance, when there are two quad-core host PCs running <tt>distccd</tt> and the local PC has a dual core CPU, then the <code>MAKEOPTS</code> variable could look like this:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=MAKEOPTS example for 2 quad-core (remote) and one dual core (local) PC|lang=bash|1=
# 2 remote hosts with 4 cores each = 8 cores remote
# 1 local host with 2 cores = 2 cores local
# total number of cores is 10, so N = 2*10+1 and M=2
MAKEOPTS="-j21 -l2"
}}

While editing the {{Path|make.conf}} file, make sure that it does not have <code>-march=native</code> in the <code>CFLAGS</code> or <code>CXXFLAGS</code> variables. <tt>distccd</tt> will not distribute work to other machines if <code>march</code> is set to <code>native</code>. The appropriate <code>-march=</code> value can be obtained by running the following command:

{{Cmd|gcc -Q -march{{=}}native --help{{=}}target}}

See [http://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2014/06/23/inlining-marchnative-for-distcc/ Inlining -march=native for distcc] for more information.

=== Specifying participating hosts ===

Use the <kbd>distcc-config</kbd> command to set the list of hosts. 

The following is an example list of host definitions. In most cases, variants of lines 1 and 2 suffice. More information about the syntax used in lines 3 and 4 can be found in the [http://distcc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/web/man/distcc_1.html distcc manual page].

{{CodeBox|title=Examples of host definitions|1=
192.168.0.1          192.168.0.2                       192.168.0.3
192.168.0.1/2        192.168.0.2                       192.168.0.3/10
192.168.0.1:4000/2   192.168.0.2/1                     192.168.0.3:3632/4
@192.168.0.1         @192.168.0.2:/usr/bin/distccd     192.168.0.3
}}

There are also several other methods of setting up hosts.  See the <tt>distcc</tt> man page (<kbd>man distcc</kbd>) for more details.

If compilations should also occur on the local machine, put <code>localhost</code> in the hosts list.  Conversely if the local machine is not to be used to compile, omit it from the hosts list.  On a slow machine using localhost may actually slow things down. Make sure to test the settings for performance.

Let's configure <tt>distcc</tt> to use the hosts mentioned on the first line in the example:

{{RootCmd|/usr/bin/distcc-config --set-hosts "192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.3"}}

Edit {{Path|/etc/conf.d/distccd}} and be sure to set the <code>--allow</code> directive to allow only trusted hosts. For added security, use the <code>--listen</code> directive to tell the <tt>distccd</tt> daemon what IP to listen on (for multi-homed systems). More information on <tt>distcc</tt> security can be found at [http://distcc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/web/security.html Distcc security notes]. 

{{Important|It is important to use <code>--allow</code> and <code>--listen</code>. Please read the <tt>distccd</tt> man page or the above security document for more information.}}

Now start the <tt>distccd</tt> daemon on all the participating computers: 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add distccd default
|rc-service distccd start}}

=== Setting up distcc to work with automake ===

This is, in some cases, easier than the Portage setup. All that is needed is to update the <code>PATH</code> variable to include {{Path|/usr/lib/distcc/bin/}} in front of the directory that contains <tt>gcc</tt> ({{Path|/usr/bin/}}). However, there is a caveat. If <tt>ccache</tt> is used, then put the distcc location after the ccache one: 

{{RootCmd|export PATH{{=}}"/usr/lib/ccache/bin:/usr/lib/distcc/bin:${PATH}"}}

Put this in the user's {{Path|~/.bashrc}} or equivalent file to have the <code>PATH</code> set every time the user logs in, or set it globally through an {{Path|/etc/env.d/}} file.

Instead of calling just <kbd>make</kbd>, add in <kbd>-jN</kbd> (where <code>N</code> is an integer). The value of <code>N</code> depends on the network and the types of computers that are used to compile. A heuristic approach to the right value is given earlier in this article.

=== Setting up distcc to work with ssh ===

Setting up distcc via ssh includes some pitfalls. First, generate an SSH key pair without password setup. Be aware that portage compiles programs as the <tt>portage</tt> user. The home folder of the <tt>portage</tt> user is {{Path|/var/tmp/portage/}}, which means the keys need to be stored in {{Path|/var/tmp/portage/.ssh/}}

{{RootCmd|ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f /var/tmp/portage/.ssh/id_rsa}}

Second, create a section for each host in the SSH configuration file:

{{FileBox|filename=/var/tmp/portage/.ssh/config|title=Add per-host sections|1=
Host test1
    HostName 123.456.789.1
    Port 1234
    User UserName
 
Host test2
    HostName 123.456.789.2
    Port 1234
    User UserName
}}

Also make sure that each host is available in the {{Path|known_hosts}} file and append the public key to the {{Path|authorized_keys}} file of the hosts. To set up the hosts <tt>test1</tt> and <tt>test2</tt>, run:

{{RootCmd|/usr/bin/distcc-config --set-hosts "@test1 @test2"}}

Please note the <tt>@</tt> (@ sign), which specifies ssh hosts for distcc.

== Cross-compiling ==

Cross-compiling is using one architecture to build programs for another architecture. This can be as simple as using an Athlon (i686) to build a program for a K6-2 (i586), or using a SPARC to build a program for a PowerPC. This is documented in the [[Distcc/Cross-Compiling|DistCC Cross-compiling guide]].

== Using distcc to bootstrap ==

=== Step 1: configure Portage ===

Boot the new box with a Gentoo Linux LiveCD and follow the [[Handbook:AMD64|installation instructions]], while keeping track of the instructions in the [[FAQ|Gentoo FAQ]] for information about bootstrapping). Then configure Portage to use <tt>distcc</tt>: 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/make.conf|title=Configure Portage to use distcc|lang=bash|1=
FEATURES="distcc"
MAKEOPTS="-jN"
}}

Update the <code>PATH</code> variable in the installation session as well:

{{RootCmd|export PATH{{=}}"/usr/lib/ccache/bin:/usr/lib/distcc/bin:${PATH}"}}

=== Step 2: getting distcc ===

Install {{Package|sys-devel/distcc}}: 

{{RootCmd|USE{{=}}'-*' emerge --nodeps sys-devel/distcc}}

=== Step 3: setting up distcc ===

Run <kbd>distcc-config --install</kbd> to setup distcc; substitute the <code>host#</code> in the example with the IP addresses or hostnames of the participating nodes.

{{RootCmd|/usr/bin/distcc-config --set-hosts "localhost host1 host2 host3 ..."}}

Distcc is now set up to bootstrap! Continue with the proper installation instructions and do ''not'' forget to run <kbd>emerge distcc</kbd> after running <kbd>emerge @system</kbd>. This is to make sure that all of the necessary dependencies are installed. 

{{Note|During bootstrap and <kbd>emerge @system</kbd> <tt>distcc</tt> may not appear to be used. This is expected as some ebuilds do not work well with distcc, so they intentionally disable it.}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Some packages don't use distcc ===

As various packages are installed, users will notice that some of them aren't being distributed (and aren't being built in parallel). This may happen because the package' {{Path|Makefile}} doesn't support parallel operations, or the maintainer of the ebuild has explicitly disabled parallel operations due to a known problem. 

Sometimes <tt>distcc</tt> might cause a package to fail to compile. If this happens, please [https://bugs.gentoo.org/ report] it.

=== Mixed GCC versions ===

If the environment hosts different GCC versions, there will likely be very weird problems. The solution is to make certain all hosts have the same GCC version. 

Recent Portage updates have made Portage use <code>${CHOST}-gcc</code> (minus gcc) instead of <code>gcc</code>. This means that if i686 machines are mixed with other types (i386, i586) then the builds will run into troubles. A workaround for this may be to run <kbd>export CC='gcc' CXX='c++'</kbd> as root in a terminal, or put it in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}}.

{{Important|Doing this explicitly redefines some behavior of Portage and may have some weird results in the future. Only do this if mixing CHOSTs is unavoidable.}}

=== -march=native ===

Starting with GCC 4.3.0, the compiler supports the <code>-march=native</code> option which turns on CPU auto-detection and optimizations that are worth being enabled on the processor on which GCC is running. This creates a problem when using <tt>distcc</tt> because it allows the mixing of code optimized for different processors. For example, running <tt>distcc</tt> with <code>-march=native</code> on a system that has an AMD Athlon processor and doing the same on ''another'' system that has an Intel Pentium processor will mix code compiled on both processors together.

Heed the following warning:

{{Warning|Do '''not''' use <code>-march{{=}}native</code> or <code>-mtune{{=}}native</code> in the <code>CFLAGS</code> or <code>CXXFLAGS</code> variables of {{Path|make.conf}} when compiling with <tt>distcc</tt>.}}

To know the flags that GCC would enable when called with <code>-march=native</code>, execute the following:

{{Cmd|gcc -march{{=}}native -E -v - &lt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 {{!}} grep cc1|output=<pre>
/usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.7.3/cc1 -E -quiet -v - -march=corei7-avx \
  -mcx16 -msahf -mno-movbe -mno-aes -mpclmul -mpopcnt -mno-abm -mno-lwp -mno-fma \
  -mno-fma4 -mno-xop -mno-bmi -mno-bmi2 -mno-tbm -mavx -mno-avx2 -msse4.2 -msse4.1 \
  -mno-lzcnt -mno-rdrnd -mno-f16c -mno-fsgsbase --param l1-cache-size=32 \
  --param l1-cache-line-size=64 --param l2-cache-size=6144 -mtune=corei7-avx
</pre>}}

== Distcc extras ==

=== Distcc monitors === 

Distcc ships with two monitoring utilities. The text-based monitoring utility is always built and is called <tt>distccmon-text</tt>. Running it for the first time can be a bit confusing, but it is really quite easy to use. If the program is run with no parameter it will run just once. However, if it is passed a number it will update every <code>N</code> seconds, where <code>N</code> is the argument that was passed.

{{Cmd|distccmon-text 10}}

The other monitoring utility is only enabled when the <code>gtk</code> <code>USE</code> flag is set.  This one is GTK+ based, runs in an X environment, and it is quite lovely.  For Gentoo, the GUI monitor has been renamed to <tt>distccmon-gui</tt> to make it less confusing (it is originally called <tt>distccmon-gnome</tt>).

{{Cmd|distccmon-gui}}

To monitor Portage's <tt>distcc</tt> usage:

{{RootCmd|DISTCC_DIR{{=}}"/var/tmp/portage/.distcc/" distccmon-text 10
|DISTCC_DIR{{=}}"/var/tmp/portage/.distcc/" distccmon-gui}}

{{Important|If the distcc directory is elsewhere, change the <code>DISTCC_DIR</code> variable accordingly.}}
