The purpose of this guide is to establish a virtual mail system that can handle multiple domains with a variety of different interface options. This is not intended to be used by the average user who is looking for a mail client, this is a full-scale Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) intended for individuals who are hosting their own domains and/or need to provide support for virtual domains.

By the end of this guide, you will have an easy method to manage a mail server that supports:
* Web based system administration
* Unlimited number of domains
* Virtual mail users without the need for shell accounts
* Domain (specific) user names
* Mailbox quotas
* Web access to email accounts
* IMAP and (very optional)POP3 support
* SMTP Authentication for secure relaying
* SSL for transport layer security
* Strong SPAM filtering
* Anti-Virus filtering
* Log Analysis

The real plus is that all of this is managed by a single database.

== Getting Started ==

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/System_Setup_and_Packages|System Setup and Packages]] ===
This section outlines a system setup (a multi-server implementation) as well as the core packages that were used. This is a MUST READ before reading on any further (don't worry, it's short).

== Basic Setup ==

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/Linux_vmail_user|Linux 'vmail' user]] ===
Mailboxes are stored on a normal filesystem and thus needs a user and group for security.

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/Admin_Support_Systems|Admin Support Systems]] ===
{{Package|www-apps/postfixadmin}} and {{Package|www-servers/apache}} were key tools in getting through testing and getting this to hang together. While the details of an Apache/PHP setup are not here, there is good information in here all the same.

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/Postfix_to_Database|Postfix to databasebackend]] ===
{{Package|mail-mta/postfix}} will be coupled to a database backend allowing virtual users on multiple domains.

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/Courier-IMAP_to_Database|Linking Courier-imap to databasebackend]] ===
{{Package|net-mail/courier-imap}} will be coupled to the same database.

== Enhanced Setup ==
=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/SMTP_Authentication|SMTP Authentication]] ===
Hainv a mailserver that relay's local mail good enough for most, being able to relay mail after authentication is extremly handy. 

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/Web_Access|Web Access]] ===
Now that a basic mailserver has been setup, web-access can be both useful and helpful during testing.

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/SSL_Certificates|SSL Certificates]] ===
Securing the mail server with SSL certificates.

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/Postfix_additions|Refining the Setup]] ===
Using default Postfix configuration options, the server gets some performance tweaks and security settings.

== Anti-Spam Measures ==

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/amvisd_spamassassin_clamav|Amavisd, Spam-Assassin and ClamAV]] ===
Defending against spam using Amavis, Spam-assassin and ClamAV for virus protection.

== Log Analyzer ==

=== [[Complete_Virtual_Mail_Server/awstats|Logging mail traffic with AWStats]] ===
Always important is monitoring. To do so AWStats is used to get a useful overview of passed messages.
