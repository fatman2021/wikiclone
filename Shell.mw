A '''shell''' is a commandline interpreter that offers a text-based interface to users. It can be used as commandline interface (CLI) on a terminal or [[terminal emulator]], or as a script interpreter running in the background.

== Shells available on Gentoo ==
* [[bash]] is the default shell on Gentoo, and is also used by [[portage]], its package manager.
* [[zsh]] is an advanced shell that is the chosen interactive shell for many users.
* [[mksh]] is an actively developed free implementation of the Korn Shell, and well suited for scripting.
* [[dash]] is the Debian Almquist shell, a small, fast, and posix-compliant shell suited for startup scripts (as {{path|/bin/sh}} replacement).
* [[tcsh]] is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C Shell (csh).
* [[fish]] is the Friendly Interactive SHell.

{{note|many scripts reference /bin/sh and this is generally a symlink to your shell of choice.}}
