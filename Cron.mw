: '' This is bcron, a new cron system designed with secure operations in mind.  To do this, the system is divided into several seperate programs, each responsible for a seperate task, with strictly controlled communications between them.  The user interface is a drop-in replacement for similar systems (such as vixie-cron), but the internals differ greatly.'' - [http://untroubled.org/bcron/ bcron homepage]

: ''Fcron is a periodical command scheduler which aims at replacing Vixie Cron, so it implements most of its functionalities. But fcron does not assume that your system is running neither all the time nor regularly : you can, for instance, tell fcron to execute tasks every x hours y minutes of system up time or to do a job only once in a specified interval of time.'' - [http://fcron.free.fr fcron hompage]

; {{Package|sys-process/anacron}}
: ''Anacron is a periodic command scheduler. It executes commands at intervals specified in days. Unlike cron, it does not assume that the system is running continuously. It can therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that don't run 24 hours a day. When installed and configured properly, Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits ...'' - [http://anacron.sourceforge.net anacron homepage]
