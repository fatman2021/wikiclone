|Embedded Gentoo using musl|
<!-- Description goes here: -->
This project involves integrating an alternative standard C library called musl into Gentoo, both for cross compiling and native compiling.  Musl aims to be "lightweight, fast, simple, free, and strives to be correct in the sense of standards-conformance and safety." [http://www.musl-libc.org]  So far, stage4 tarballs have been built for amd64 [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/amd64/musl], i686 [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/x86/musl] and armv7a-hardfloat-eabi [http://distfiles.gentoo.org/experimental/arm/musl].  These were initially built using cross compiling toolchians which themselves were built using crossdev [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/embedded/handbook/cross-compiler.xml?style=printable], but then were rebuilt on native hardware using home grown scripts [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/releng.git;a=tree;f=tools-musl], and not catalyst [https://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/catalyst]. Picking up from here, the next steps in the project are:

1) To build cross compiling toolschains for mips32r2-o32, mipsel3-o32 and mips64r2-n32 architectures/abis.  This will involve properly intergrating musl with crossdev which currently has some bugs [https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=498114].

2) To build stage 4 tarballs for the those architectures.  This involves, among other things, patching various packages that don't conform to strict POSIX which musl assumes [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/hardened-dev.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/musl].

3) These stages need to be converted to stage3's, properly built using catalyst rather than using the ROOT=rootfs emerge -e @system technique which the homegrown scripts use.

4) If all goes well, the project can continue to porting over the hardened tool chain to those architectures [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened].
