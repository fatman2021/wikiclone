The ''Linux kernel'' is the core of the operating system and offers an interface for programs to access the hardware. The kernel contains most of the device drivers.

== Installation == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
To create a kernel, it is necessary to install the kernel source code first. The recommended kernel sources for a desktop system are {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}. These are maintained by the Gentoo developers, and patched to fix security vulnerabilities, functional problems, as well as to improve compatibility with rare system architectures.

<!--T:4-->
Before installing, check the active [[USE flag]]s. The USE flags of '''gentoo-sources''' are:

<!--T:5-->
* ''deblob'' - Remove binary blobs from kernel sources to provide [[Wikipedia:Free software|free software]] compliance.
* ''build'' - (Not recommended) Only for creating stages. Never set this USE flag yourself.
* ''symlink'' - Sets the <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> symlink for these kernel sources.

<!--T:6-->
Now [[emerge|install]] '''gentoo-sources''':

{{Emerge|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}

<!--T:7-->
There are various alternative kernel sources in the [[Portage tree]]:

<!--T:8-->
* {{Package|sys-kernel/vanilla-sources}} - The official, non-patched Linux kernel sources. Note that because they are left as is, and do not contain any additional patches, they are not supported by Gentoo developers.

<!--T:9-->
* A full list with short descriptions can be found by searching with emerge:

; [[Kernel/Configuration|Manual configuration]]: Manual configuration enables you, with some effort, to create a custom-fit kernel configuration.

<!--T:24-->
; [[genkernel|Automatic configuration]]: '''genkernel''' is a tool to automatically configure and setup a kernel. The needed drivers for your system are detected and loaded at boot time. 

<!--T:25-->
; [[Kernel/Upgrade|Upgrade]]: Steps to upgrade to a new kernel using an existing configuration.

<!--T:26-->
; [[Kernel/Removal|Removal]]: Steps to completely remove old kernels.
