'''AutoFS''' uses the Linux kernel Automounter to automatically mount several types of media like memory sticks, network shares, CD-Rom/DVD/BR etc. on demand.

== Installation ==

=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
File systems --->
    <*> Kernel automounter version 4 support (also supports v3)
</pre>}}

=== Software ===
Install {{Package|net-fs/autofs}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-fs/autofs
|dmalloc
|hesiod
|ldap
|libtirpc
|sasl
|mount-locking
}}

{{Emerge|autofs}}

== Configuration ==

=== Service ===
Start and add AutoFS to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/autofs start
|rc-update add autofs default}}

=== Files ===
The configuration files are located in:
* {{Path|/etc/conf.d/autofs}}
* {{Path|/etc/autofs/auto.master}}
* {{Path|/etc/autofs/auto.misc}}

== Usage ==
General configuration files for AutoFS. 
{{Important|You probably need to install additional software and modules to mount DVD, NFS, CIFS etc. The mount helpers need to be available for each file system you configure.}}

=== autofs configuration ===
The default options for autofs can be changed by setting the proper configuration variables located in /etc/conf.d/autofs; in the following example, the default location for the master map (/etc/auto.master) is changed by setting the MASTER_MAP_NAME  configuration variable:
{{File|/etc/conf.d/autofs||<pre>
#
# Define default options for autofs.
#
# MASTER_MAP_NAME - map name for the master map;
#                   default is /etc/auto.master
#
MASTER_MAP_NAME="/etc/autofs/auto.master"
#</pre>}}
{{Note|The following examples of configuration files take into account the new location for auto.master.}}

=== auto.master ===
In this configuration file is defined what other configuration files should be included as root mount-point. Here is one example with one additional mount-point on /mnt/auto
{{File|/etc/autofs/auto.master||<pre>
+auto.master # extry needed for NIS mapping
# Here are the files listed, that should be included
# mount-point | config file | options
/mnt/auto   /etc/autofs/auto.misc    --timeout=15 --ghost
</pre>}}
{{Note|/mnt/auto is the root mount-point for all file systems defined in auto.misc. ''--timeout'' defines how many seconds to wait before the file system is unmounted. ''--ghost'' creates empty folders for each mount-point in auto.misc, this prevents timeouts if a network share cannot be contacted.}}

=== auto.misc ===
Here is our example for the file auto.misc. The folders for the mount-points are automatically created
{{File|/etc/autofs/auto.misc||<pre>
# mount-point below /mnt/auto | mount options | device, network share etc.

# CD-Rom on /mnt/auto/cd
cd              -fstype=iso9660,ro,nosuid,nodev              :/dev/cdrom
# nework share mounted via NFSv3 on /mnt/auto/data
data            -rw,vers=3,soft,async                        192.168.0.254:/tank1/data
# nework share mounted via CIFS on /mnt/auto/data1
data1           -fstype=cifs,credentials=/root/smb.txt       ://192.168.0.254/data1
# memory stick used regulary with known UUID, for example a kindle
kindle          -fstype=vfat,rw,uid=1000                     :UUID="4CBF-23A2"</pre>}}
{{Note|There are several more examples in the auto.misc that comes with the package}}
