=Samba/Win AD Centralized authentication=
This might look a bit weird at 1st but when working on the migration from samba 3 with LDAP to samba 4 AD.<br />
This seem to be the only choice we have as we have to remove the LDAP Server on the server that running Samba 4 AD.<br />

Else you would have 2 server.<br />
Windows Client using Samba 4 AD and Linux client using an LDAP Server from another which is no longer centralized and defeated the purpose.

== Working method and choice ==
There are a few method. 
# nslcd or nss_pam_ldapd
# sssd

= nslcd or nss_pam_ldapd = 
If you are using 64 bit system, you will need to unmask it.
{{Code|Add these line to /etc/portage/package.keywords|<pre>
#nss-pam-ldapd replacement of both nss_ldap and nss_pam
sys-auth/nss-pam-ldapd ~amd64
</pre>}}

This package will provide what is currently provide by nss_ldap and also nss_pam thus the 2 package have to be removed.
{{Emerge
|nss_ldap nss_pam
|params=--unmerge --ask
}}

Now we can start emerge nss_pam_ldapd
{{Emerge|nss_pam_ldapd}}

== Configuration ==
There are at least 2 method to work on this solution, the result are same but the way of working it are different.
Pick one...
<ref name="nss-pam-ldapd setup">[http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/setup nss-pam-ldapd setup]http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/setup</ref>

=== Method 1:  Connecting to AD via LDAP Bind DN and password ===
This method will configure /etc/nslcd.conf to make LDAP binding via an AD account. Communication with AD with this setup is unencrypted, unless your AD and nslcd had setup LDAP over SSL.

Please create a new user with username '''nslcdconnect''' and password '''secret'''.<br />
You might need to do the following:
* ''Enable - disable user change password on next logon''
* ''Disable - user change password''
* ''Enable - Password never expired''.

Assuming that:<br />
* Samba is running locally and accessible via 127.0.0.1
* LDAP Base DN is dc=headoffice,dc=location1,dc=company,dc=com
