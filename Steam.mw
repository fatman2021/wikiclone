Valve has released a native (currently x86-only) Linux client for their [https://steampowered.com Steam platform] available to all steam users.

== Notice == 
The .deb released by Valve is actually only an installer that pulls the actual steam version from their servers and places it as well as the games into ~/Steam/. So, the official package manager cannot be involved in managing games and steam updates.

== Games ==
* Official Valve Linux [http://store.steampowered.com/browse/linux/ Games List]
* [http://cdr.xpaw.ru/linux/ CDR List] (includes future (beta) releases for Linux)

== Prerequisites ==
Things you need in order to run steam or even the steam-installer.

=== Dependencies ===
If you don't plan on using the ebuild then you can create a '''set''' to conveniently manage and update the steam dependencies without changing your world file. Otherwise skip this section.
After you have created the file ''/etc/portage/sets/steam'' as shown below, run: {{Emerge|@steam}}

==== 32-bit chroot on amd64 ====

The emul-linux-x86-* packages are binaries, and are not kept very well up-to-date. For this reason, you will probably experience better performance and compatibility with games on 64 bit linux if you run in a 32 bit chroot.


{{Cmd
|mkdir /usr/local/steam32 && cd /usr/local/steam32
|wget http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/x86/autobuilds/current-stage3/stage3-i686-20130827.tar.bz2 && tar -xvpf stage3*.tar.bz2
|mkdir usr/portage && mkdir usr/local/portage
|mount --rbind /usr/portage portage && mount --rbind /dev dev && mount --rbind /sys sys && mount -t proc none proc
|cp /etc/resolv.conf etc
|git clone https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay usr/local/portage/steam-overlay
|echo PORTDIR_OVERLAY{{=}}"/usr/local/portage/steam-overlay" >> etc/portage/make.conf && grep VIDEO_CARDS /etc/portage/make.conf >> etc/portage/make.conf && echo ">{{=}}media-libs/mesa-9.2 ~x86" >>etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
|chroot .
|useradd -m steam && usermod -a -G video steam && usermod -a -G audio steam
|USE{{=}}"steamruntime" emerge -av steam-meta alsa-utils libtxc_dxtn dbus mesa# you'll have to autounmask-write, etc-update, to set keywords/useflags then actually emerge
}}

Then create a wrapper script to chroot in, su to steam user, then run steam. 

{{File|/usr/local/bin/steam32|Wrapper for steam32 '''amd64'''|<pre>
CHROOT_DIR=/usr/local/steam32

mount --rbind /dev $CHROOT_DIR/dev 
mount --rbind /sys $CHROOT_DIR/sys
mount -t proc none $CHROOT_DIR/proc
[ ! -f $CHROOT_DIR/var/run/dbus.pid ] && chroot $CHROOT_DIR dbus-launch --system
chroot $CHROOT_DIR su steam -c "dbus-launch steam"
umount -l $CHROOT_DIR/dev
umount -l $CHROOT_DIR/sys
umount -l $CHROOT_DIR/proc

</pre>}}

=== Kernel ===
You need [[tmpfs]] activated in your kernel and {{Path|/dev/shm}} mounted.
{{Note|/dev/shm should be automatically mounted by the devfs initscript, however you can do so explicitly and with additional options via fstab.}}
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
# to limit the size add e.g. size=768M to opts (default is 50%)

#<fs>      <mountpoint>    <type>	<opts>		     <dump/pass>
shm        /dev/shm        tmpfs        nodev,nosuid,noexec  0 0
</pre>}}

== Installation ==
Download the .deb archive found [http://media.steampowered.com/client/installer/steam.deb here], extract[http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/functions/src_unpack/deb-sources/index.html] and put the following files into the same directory:
* bootstraplinux_ubuntu12_32.tar.xz (from the .deb archive)
* steam.desktop (from the .deb archive)
* steam (get the script [http://gentoo.pastebin.ca/raw/2339758 here] or [https://gist.github.com/hasufell/d02a93eccbe35be7a803/raw/987ea287dc81a60d2eb5fa1bb188eae0a5f1049f/steam here]) '''[last update: 2013-03-24]'''
Make '''steam''' executable and run it. There are also a few icons in the .deb archive.
{{Note|Alternatively you can use the steam-meta ebuild from [https://github.com/anyc/steam-overlay steam-overlay].}}

== Client Troubleshooting ==
A few tricks to get things working.

=== Video drivers ===
* [[nVidia/nvidia-drivers|nvidia-drivers]]: You will need to unmask latest {{Package|x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers}}.
* If S3TC support is missing, install {{Package|media-libs/libtxc_dxtn}}.
* Starting some games (TF, CS:S) on legacy ATI drivers will give this error: "Required OpenGL extension "GL_EXT_texture_sRGB_decode" is not supported. Please update your OpenGL driver." Workaround is [http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/846938351012409765/ here].

=== Fonts ===
Some people seem to have problems with missing fonts. A user reported it being solved by emerging {{Package|media-fonts/font-bitstream-100dpi}}.

Sometimes Xorg does not recognize the new fonts installed. To fix this temp. run:
{{Cmd
|xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/100dpi/
|./steam.sh
}}

You may also need {{Package|media-fonts/corefonts}} if fonts don't appear to be rendering correctly.

The game [http://www.stealthbastard.com/ Stealth Bastard Deluxe] will segfault if {{Package|media-fonts/font-misc-misc}} is not installed [http://steamcommunity.com/app/209190/discussions/0/810923580565231302/].

=== Mouse cursor ===
If your WM/DE does not set a mouse pointer theme, then Steam will overwrite the default X11 cursor theme, often resulting in a reversed pointer from left to right.

To fix this, just install and enable a compatible cursor theme via your WM/DE (e.g. {{Package|x11-themes/vanilla-dmz-xcursors}}).

You can also enable the installed theme manually with the following method:
{{Cmd
|mkdir ~/.icons
|ln -s /usr/share/cursors/xorg-x11/Vanilla-DMZ ~/.icons/default
}}
{{Note|This fix will not work if you will try to symlink a KDE cursor theme (eg: Oxygen_White).}}
If the mouse cursor gets stuck pointing in the wrong direction after exiting steam you can work around that via:
{{Cmd|xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr}}

=== Flashplayer on amd64 ===
Get the [http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_11.2_for_other_Linux_(.tar.gz)_32-bit 32bit flashplayer from adobe] and extract ''libflashplayer.so'' to your current working dir. Now run:
{{Cmd
|mkdir <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins
|mv libflashplayer.so <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/
|chmod +x <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/libflashplayer.so
}}
Alternatively emerge {{Package|www-plugins/adobe-flash}} with '''32bit''' USE flag and run:
{{Cmd
|mkdir <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins
|ln -s /opt/Adobe/flash-player32/libflashplayer.so <path-to-steam-installation>/ubuntu12_32/plugins/
}}

=== Memory corruption on startup ===
You might get an error like this:
{{Cmd|steam|output=<pre>
*** glibc detected *** zenity: malloc(): memory corruption: 0x00000000016cf020 ***
</pre>}}
Try to emerge {{Package|x11-libs/libXi}} and it should work.

=== Hardened Gentoo ===
It looks like the steam binary has rwx bits in it. You will need to mark the binary with the following to get it working on a hardened system.
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam}}

Binaries of most games also should be paxmarked, for ex.:
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/"World of Goo/WorldOfGoo"}}
{{Cmd|paxctl-ng -m ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Uplink/uplink.bin.x86_64}}

After latest update (around Jul 2013) steam also need paxmarked sh or it fail to run games from steam client (see https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/254 for details):
{{Cmd|sudo paxctl-ng -m /bin/bash}}
However, this causes bash to not run.

=== Steam runtime ===
By default, Valve bundles own libraries with the steam package and uses them instead of installed system libraries. This behavior can be changed by setting the environment variable STEAM_RUNTIME=0 or starting steam with
{{Cmd|STEAM_RUNTIME{{=}}0 steam}}

Enabling the steam runtime can fix problems with missing libraries. Use STEAM_RUNTIME=1 if you see error messages like
{{Code||<pre>
Error: You are missing the following 32-bit libraries, and Steam may not run:
libSDL2-2.0.so.0
</pre>}}

=== Reset Steam client ===
If you want to wipe out your current steam installation and reinstall steam without losing games data, you can use the --reset command line option:
{{Cmd|steam --reset}}

== Games Troubleshooting ==

If you have issues on 64 bit, it's because emul-linux-x86-* are typically very out of date. 

You can try using a 32-bit chroot.

=== Team Fortress 2 ===
If you only get a black screen for 1-2 seconds, try adding "-nojoy" to Game->Properties->"Set Launch Options".

=== Dota 2 ===

If you notice [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/683 lots of black textures], it's because the mesa driver is out of date, until version 9.1.6 or higher is released as part of emul-linux-x86-opengl, you will have to resort to using a 32 bit chroot.
