=== xorg.conf ===
The [[X server]] is designed to work out-of-the-box, with no need to manually edit X.Org's configuration files. It should detect and configure devices such as displays, keyboards, and mice.

However, the main configuration file of the X server is the [[xorg.conf]].

=== Multi Monitor Problems ===
If you're having problems with freezing with possible EDID probes when using dual monitors/displays, try adding "video=VGA-1:e" to your grub.cfg/grub2.cfg command line options, substituting the name of your monitor listed within dmesg or /var/log/Xorg.0.log.  (ie. VGA-1, LVDS-1, DVI-1)
