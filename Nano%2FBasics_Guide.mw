This guide is meant to be a simple introduction to nano. It will quickly help you to become familiar with its basic operation.

== Nano Basics ==

=== Purpose ===

This guide was written to cover basic operations in nano, and is meant to be very concise. For more information about nano check out: [http://www.nano-editor.org http://www.nano-editor.org].

=== Opening and creating files ===

Opening and creating files is simple in nano, simply type: 

{{RootCmd|nano filename}}

Nano is a modeless editor so you can start typing immediately to insert text. If you are editing a configuration file like {{Path|/etc/fstab}} use the <code>-w</code> switch to disable wrapping on long lines as it might render the configuration file unparseable by whatever tools depend on it. For example: 

{{RootCmd|nano -w /etc/fstab}}

{{Warning|It is very, very important that you use the <code>-w</code> switch when opening a config file. Failure to do so may keep your system from booting or cause other bad things.}}

=== Saving and exiting ===

If you want to save the changes you've made, press {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|O}}. To exit nano, type {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|X}}. If you ask nano to exit from a modified file, it will ask you if you want to save it. Just press {{Key|N}} in case you don't, or {{Key|Y}} in case you do. It will then ask you for a filename. Just type it in and press {{Key|Enter}}. 

If you accidentally confirmed that you want to save the file but you actually don't, you can always cancel by pressing {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|C}} when you're prompted for a filename.

=== Cutting and pasting ===

To cut a single line, you use {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|K}} (hold down {{Key|Ctrl}} and then press {{Key|K}}). The line disappears. To paste it, you simply move the cursor to where you want to paste it and punch {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|U}}. The line reappears. To move multiple lines, simply cut them with several {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|K}} in a row, then paste them with a single {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|U}}. The whole paragraph appears wherever you want it. 

If you need a little more fine-grained control, then you have to mark the text. Move the cursor to the beginning of the text you want to cut. Hit {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|6}} (or {{Key|Alt}} + {{Key|A}}). Now move your cursor to the end of the text you want to cut: the marked text gets highlighted. If you need to cancel your text marking, simply hit {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|6}} again. Press {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|K}} to cut the marked text. Use {{Key|Ctrl}} + {{Key|U}} to paste it.

=== Searching for text ===

Searching for a string is easy as long as you think ''"WhereIs"'' instead of ''"Search"'' . Simply hit <code>Ctrl+W</code> , type in your search string, and press <code>Enter</code> . To search for the same string again, hit <code>Alt+W</code> . 

{{Note|In nano's help texts the Ctrl-key is represented by a caret ( <code>^</code> ), so <code>Ctrl+W</code> is shown as <code>^W</code> , and so on. The Alt-key is represented by an <code>M</code> (from "Meta"), so <code>Alt+W</code> is shown as <code>M-W</code> .}}

=== More options ===

If you're interested in tweaking nano, be sure to read {{Path|/etc/nanorc}} .
