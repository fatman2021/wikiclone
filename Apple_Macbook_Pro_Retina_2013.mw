== Models ==
There are 3 models overall: 13", 15"-intel-only, 15"-nvidia+intel

== Installation Steps ==
The System Rescue CD 4 works fine, pending a caveat due the SSD triggering a strange behaviour with SATA.

Setting the queue_size to 1 workarounds it:

{{Cmd|echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/queue_depth}}

== Bootloader ==

Refind which is a fork of Refit and is being actively development and maintained. For installation see [http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#installsh this link].

== Kernel ==

Configure your kernel as normal, but add the following options for EFI Stub:
{{Kernel||<pre>
Processor type and features  --->
  [*] EFI runtime service support 
  [*] EFI stub support
  [*] Built-in kernel command line
  (root=/dev/sda4) Built-in kernel command string
</pre>}}

Make sure the root= line on your kernel command line configuration is correct. More details about Kernel configuration for EFI stub are here: [[EFI stub kernel]].

This assumes you do not need an initramfs. I do not use one. If you do, the EFI stub method may not be the easiest method. But it can still be done, refer to the [[EFI_stub_kernel]] page.

Also, add the following Kernel options for driver support (these options are in addition to the standard options you would select for Intel based PC's):

{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
  Input device support  --->
    [*] Mice  --->
    # For trackpad support
    <*> Apple USB BCM5974 Multitouch trackpad support
  Hardware Monitoring support  --->
    # Motion, light sensor, keyboard backlight
    <*> Apple SMC (Motion sensor, light sensor, keyboard backlight)
  Graphics support  --->
    <*> Intel 8xx/9xx/G3x/G4x/HD Graphics
    Backlight & LCD device support  --->
      # Screen backlight
      <*>     Apple Backlight Driver
  X86 Platform Specific Device Drivers  --->
    <*>   Apple Gmux Driver
  Multimedia support  --->
    Media USB Adapters  --->
      # Webcam
      <M>   USB Video Class (UVC)
  Sound card support  --->
    Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
      PCI sound devices  --->
        <M>   Intel HD Audio  --->
          [*]   Build HDMI/DisplayPort HD-audio codec support
          [*]   Build Cirrus Logic codec support
</pre>}}

Ensure the following options are NOT set (required for proper Broadcom wireless):
{{Kernel||<pre>
Networking support  --->
  Wireless  --->
    < >   Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack (mac80211)
Device Drivers  ---> 
  Network device support  --->
    Wireless LAN  --->
      < >   Broadcom 43xx wireless support (mac80211 stack)
      < >   Broadcom IEEE802.11n embedded FullMAC WLAN driver
  Sonics Silicon Backplane  --->
    < > Sonics Silicon Backplane support
</pre>}}

The normal make install works since refind would pick up your kernel directly.
