'''''Tethering''' means sharing the Internet connection of an Internet-capable mobile phone with other devices. This sharing can be offered over a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), or over Bluetooth, or by physical connection using a cable'' ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering Wikipedia]).

Our focus in this article will be the '''USB tethering'''.<br />
Your Android mobile phone can behave as an external network interface <tt>usbN</tt>, connected via the USB infrastructure. The <tt>usbN</tt> interface is in turn connected to the mobile phone LAN, providing dhcp server, DNS server, gateway and so on.<br />
That's how your mobile phone can provide an Internet connection to another device.

Android phones are already equipped to provide this functionality. Simply connect the USB cable and go to Settings -> Wireless settings -> Tethering -> Tethering USB.

What you need is some kernel and network configuration on the other side (e.g. your laptop).

== Tested Devices ==
* '''Google Nexus One''' (Android 2.3.6 build GRK39F)
* '''Google Nexus 4''' (Android 4.3 build JWR66Y)
* '''LG P350''' (Android 2.2.1 build FRG83)
* '''LG E400''' (Android 2.3.6 build GRK39F)
* '''Motorola Defy''' (Android 2.3.7 Cyanogenmod 7)
* '''Samsung Galaxy S i9000'''
* '''Samsung Galaxy Nexus i9250''' (Android 4.0.1 ITL41D)
* '''Samsung Galaxy S2'''

== Kernel configuration ==
{{Kernel|.config 3.0.6-gentoo|
General setup  --->
    [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
Device Drivers --->
    [*] Network device support --->
        USB Network Adapters --->
            [*] Multi-purpose USB Networking Framework
                <M> CDC Ethernet support
                <M> CDC EEM support
                <M> Simple USB Network Links (CDC Ethernet subset)
                <M>   Host for RNDIS and ActiveSync devices
            [*] Embedded ARM Linux links
}}
You can either build the options in the kernel or leave them as module.
{{Note|The ''RNDIS'' option seems to be needed in some situation only. See [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-843255-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-0.html this thread] to learn more.}}

{{RootCmd|ifconfig -a}}
If you see <tt>usb0</tt> (or whatever number you'll get) you are all set.

== Connecting ==
Since the mobile phone LAN changes its addresses, you need a DHCP client to configure the <tt>usbN</tt> device.

If you are on a laptop, you probably have a DHCP client. If not, emerge {{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd}}.
{{Emerge|net-misc/dhcpcd}}

=== Manually ===
Simply run <tt>dhcpcd</tt> after plug/mobile activation.
{{RootCmd|dhcpcd usb0}}

=== Permanent configuration ===
Edit your <tt>/etc/conf.d/net</tt> to have a permanent, automatic activation of the interface.
{{RootCmd|echo "config_usb0{{=}}\"dhcp\"" >> /etc/conf.d/net}}
Once plugged in and activated on the mobile phone side, the usb0 will be up and configured.

=== Checks ===
Run the usual checks to verify your connection.
{{RootCmd
|ifconfig usb0
|route
|cat /etc/resolv.conf
}}

== Advanced network settings ==
The DHCP is very quick, but the default settings don't give you as much freedom as you may want.<br />

A possible scenario is that you are in a corporate, protected LAN context that doesn't give you the Internet connection but where you need to stay connected to have access to some Intranet resource.<br />
Or maybe you have a free but limited connection (a public wifi allowing http only, an evil firewall, etc.). Since mobile connections could be expensive, you could want to save your money up using the tethering only when needed.<br />
Here is a handful of examples about the DHCP usage.

If you want to limit the information set by DHPC, you can fine-tune its behaviour.

E.g.:
{{RootCmd|dhcpcd --nogateway --nohook resolv.conf --nohook hostname usb0}}
This will let your default gateway, resolv.conf and hostname as they are, letting you provide extra info by hand.

E.g.:
{{RootCmd|route add -host my_sshd_remote_host_IP dev usb0}}

Finally, you can permanently configure your USB network interface.<br />
E.g.
{{Code|/etc/conf.d/net|
<pre>config_usb0="dhcp"
dhcpcd_usb0="--nogateway --nohook resolv.conf --nohook hostname"
# Special hosts
postup()
{
    if [[ "usb0" == ${IFACE} ]]; then
        route add -host my_sshd_remote_host_IP dev usb0
    fi
}
</pre>
}}

Generally, you can avoid every DHCP setting (see the [[man page]]) but gather them with
{{RootCmd|dhcpcd -U usb0}}
Then you can set what you want in the <tt>postup</tt> hook.
