Open Sound System (OSS) v4 is an alternative to [[ALSA]] as a layer between programs and sound hardware. Users of v3 are encouraged to use the not so maintained v4 version which has a BSD and GPL-2 licences.

== Installation ==
Currently there is no maintained ebuild in portage for this software.

=== Kernel ===
{{Kernel|Sound card support|<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
        <M> Sound card support  --->
             --- Sound card support
             < >   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture --->
             < >   Open Sound System (DEPRECATED)  ---></pre>}}

=== Ebuild ===
There are many more or less active overlays for ebuilds. Most of them require [[layman]] to have ''git'' or ''mercurial'' support:
{{RootCmd|echo 'app-portage/layman git mercurial' >> /etc/portage/package.use
|emerge layman}}

==== angelos-overlay ====
[http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=dev/angelos.git;a=raw angelos-overlay] seems pretty up to date and maintained by a Gentoo developer. <3 Christoph<br>
To use it:
{{RootCmd|layman -a angelos}}

==== oss-overlay ====
This overlay is quiet outdated but might become more recent in the future.
{{RootCmd|layman -a oss-overlay}}

==== bar-overlay ====
{{Warning|This overlay replaces up to date ebuilds in portage and doesn't follow the official guidelines for keywording. Not true anymore as of 2012/07/31 23:33.}}
To add the ''bar-overlay'' to layman, please follow the instructions on [https://github.com/tokiclover/bar-overlay bar-overlay]<br>
There are USE flags in media-sound/oss::bar so that one can build selected drivers instead using the OSS_CARDS environment variable.
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>OSS_CARDS="cmi878x cmpci hdaudio ich imux midiloop midimix usb userdev"</pre>}}

==== bug report ====
Ebuilds can also be found in {{Bug|184123}}, which would need to be added to the local overlay

=== Install ===
Build the modules and add {{Path|/etc/init.d/oss}} to the default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|emerge oss
|rc-update add oss default}}

== Configuration ==
General configuration after install.

=== Compatibility ===
* Many application only provide support for ALSA, therefore it is a good idea to keep both USE flags
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>USE="... alsa oss ..."</pre>}}
OSS will create ALSA devices for those applications.
{{Note|in the current ebuilds, this feature can be disabled using a USE flag like ''salsa'' or ''libalsa''}}
* to be able to use OSS4 with [[GNOME]] or other gstreamer dependent desktop environments like xfce4. Once again, {{Package|media-plugins/gst-plugins-oss4}} which is included in {{Package|media-libs/gst-plugins-good}}! was dropped from the official tree, so you will have to make your own ebuild (quite easy for this one) or else grab one somewhere (bar-overlay, for example).
{{Emerge|media-plugins/gst-plugins-oss4}}

=== CMI878x ===
Unlike ALSA, OSS4 has fewer complex options to configure, so you won't need any `soundon.user'.  Especially if your setup isn't complex or are using more than one sound card. In the latter case, you may want to keep a `soundon.user' file to be able to choose your first card (first card equal default card) and then put a few lines to correct devices nodes which can be a little problematic.

The previous script will check if there are devices nodes, so a sound card, with CMI878x driver and then relink almost everything to it or else use HDAudio.

{{Note|Notice that, that file will be overridden whenever media-sound/oss is updated so you will have to add that file to:}}

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
CONFIG_PROTECT="... /usr/lib/oss/soundon.user ..."
</pre>}}

Or else, create a file like `~/.scripts/soundon.user' and edit `/etc/init.d/oss' to your liking.

{{File|/etc/init.d/oss||<pre>
	/usr/sbin/soundon
	/root/.scripts/soundon.user
	/usr/sbin/savemixer -L
</pre>}}

Now you can enjoy Open Sound System. I found the sound with OSS4 to be better than what I can get with ALSA. There was a time when my CMI878x sound works only with OSS4 but a few things changed.

OSS4 has its own mixer so using extra sound daemons like pulseaudio, esd etc. is not necessary.

== Usage ==
OSS4 has several comandline tools and one gtk-GUI to configure the devices.

=== osstest ===
Maybe it just works, test all audio devices with the following command:
{{Cmd|osstest}}

=== ossxmix ===
ossxmix is the graphical tool to configure devices:
