== The vmail user ==
Because valid UNIX user and group id's are needed to store the mailboxes, those should be created as well.
Most services get a system ID under 1000.
In Gentoo the user ID's start at 1000.
An ID of 5000 is chosen for the vmail user.
If there is a ton of shell users on the system a different ID can be used as well.
For the vmail group the same is done.
This will not be a shell account for anybody to log in with.

{{RootCmd|groupadd -g 5000 vmail|
useradd -m -d /var/vmail -s /bin/false -u 5000 -g vmail vmail}}

{{Note|Nitpicking, specifying uid and gid isn't really required, but it's always tidy to think about it. After the users and groups have been added, it may wise to edit the /etc/passwd and /etc/group and move the new user and group to an appropriate place. This because by default useradd and groupadd will increase the last found entry and thus a new user would be 5001. This obviously is only important if these files needed to be kept organized and clean.}}

== Storage space ==
Next to think about is the mail storage.
This can be a partition, an nfs share or any ordinary sub-directory.
Here {{Path|/var/vmail}} is chosen as noted above and created as a 32GiB raid10 partition.
Wherever it is chosen to be stored, ownership should be changed appropriately.

{{RootCmd|chown vmail:vmail /var/vmail/}}

Also permissions should be set up properly.
{{RootCmd|chmod 2770 /var/vmail/}}

Check the permissions.
{{RootCmd|ls -ld /var/vmail|output=
drwxrws--- 3 vmail vmail 4096 Aug  2 07:24 /var/vmail
}}

== Vmail user and Postfix ==
Postfix needs to know under what permissions to store mail.
{{Note|If required, this also can be looked up on a per user basis from the database. For example, when the maildirs are not located in a central directory, but in each users homedirectory. In this document, the vmail user is the only user to be allowed access, and thus this is not touched on.}}

{{File|/etc/postfix/main.cf|Binding UID and GID's to postfix|<pre>
# Link the mailbox uid and gid to postfix.
virtual_uid_maps = static:5000
virtual_gid_maps = static:5000
</pre>}}
