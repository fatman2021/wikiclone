'''Libav''' is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes libavcodec — the leading audio/video codec library.

==Software not building with Libav==
Normally some old software might not be ready for the 0.8 or even the 0.7 libav api.
The most outstanding issue are:
* libavutil specific function being used without including the required header
: include <libavutil/mathematics.h> to include av_rescale_q()
: include <libavutil/avstring.h> to include the av_str functions
* FFmpeg only calls used
:avformat_alloc_output_context2() might be the most used, it is a shortcut for calling avformat_alloc_context() followed by using av_guess_format() and an av_strlcpy of the filename.

==Installation==
Libav is installable with:
{{Emerge|media-video/libav}}

==Usage==
Libav provides a new commandline tool to manipulate streams called avconv. Its aim is similar to the ffmpeg command from FFmpeg (also provided as legacy) but the syntax had been changed to be more regular and it aims to solve some long standing issues regarding timestamp guessing/generation that had been a bane for everybody trying to transcode live streams in the past.
