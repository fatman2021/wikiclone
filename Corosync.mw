'''Corosync''' is the currently preferred [[cluster]] messaging layer in the Linux cluster community. It is typically used with [[Pacemaker]] to set up Gentoo-based clusters.

== Installing ==
Recently there has been a fair amount of standardization-oriented changes within the Linux cluster community. Perhaps as a result, at present the version of Corosync available in the portage tree is out of date.  

=== Download ===
To get the absolutely latest version of Corosync installed (usually a good idea), you can take the following steps.

First, download the 'git HEAD' (latest release) ''corosync'' ebuild from [https://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=320006 here] ({{Bug|429416}}) and temporarily install it in to your local [[overlay]].

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/sys-cluster/corosync
|cd /usr/local/portage/sys-cluster/corosync
|wget -O corosync-9999.ebuild 'https://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id{{=}}320006'
|ebuild corosync-9999.ebuild manifest}}

You can also unmask/ emerge the version from portage which is pretty recent as of Q1 2013.

=== Unmask ===
Next, unmask the package:
{{RootCmd|echo '{{=}}sys-cluster/corosync-9999' >>/etc/portage/package.unmask}}

If you are on amd64 or another untested architecture, you may also need to do the following:
{{RootCmd|echo '{{=}}sys-cluster/corosync-9999' >>/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords}}

=== Install ===
Now install corosync:
{{Emerge|corosync}}

== Configuring ==
Gentoo installs the example corosync configuration in to {{Path|/etc/corosync/corosync.conf.example}}. First copy this to {{Path|/etc/corosync/corosync.conf}}:
{{RootCmd|cp /etc/corosync/corosync.conf.example /etc/corosync/corosync.conf}}

Then edit the file to express your appropriate configuration. The main resources for configuration are the [[man page]]s, accessible via:
{{Cmd|man corosync_overview
|man corosync.conf}}

For the ''quorum'' section, you can also review:
{{Cmd|man votequorum}}

=== Note for two-node clusters ===
If you only have two nodes, you will need to enable the ''two_nodes'' directive under the ''quorum{}'' section, ie:
<pre>
quorum {
 provider: corosync_votequorum
 expected_votes: 2
 two_nodes: 1
}
</pre>

=== Note on hostnames ===
When building clusters with Corosync and Pacemaker, the primary management tool '''crm_mon''' will identify hosts based upon their hostname. Therefore it is desirable to set a hostname that is definitely unique on each node. You can achieve this easily in one of two ways, either setting up hostname entries on your DHCP server (if nodes are DHCP configured), or by setting the hostname from a unique identifier (such as the eth0 MAC address). Here's my hack for the latter, which I run from a custom {{Path|/init}} (passed as a kernel option to diskless nodes with [[NFS]] root):
<pre>
# set hostname
hostname `cat /sys/class/net/eth0/address|sed 's/://'`
echo "hostname=\"`hostname`\"" >/etc/conf.d/hostname
</pre>

If you find yourself with the cluster remembering old/wrong hostname for nodes and you are still in the testing phase, then you can resolve the issue by shutting down all cluster nodes, removing their {{Path|/var/lib/corosync/ring*}} cache files, and restarting.  This might not be a good idea on live clusters.

== Running ==
Corosync is managed as a standard [[OpenRC]] service, ie. you can start and stop it as follows.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/corosync start}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/corosync restart}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/corosync status}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/corosync stop}}

== Debugging ==
Corosync logs to {{Path|/var/log/cluster/corosync.log}} by default. To view the log, run:
{{Cmd|tailf /var/log/cluster/corosync.log}}

If you are having issues even starting Corosync successful (such as receiving "Status: crashed" when executing ''/etc/init.d/corosync status''), then you can start the daemon manually with the -f (foreground) option as follows.  (You might also consider first enabling the ''log_to_stderr'' directive within {{Path|/etc/corosync/corosync.conf}}):
{{RootCmd|/usr/sbin/corosync -f}}

== Next steps ==
Once you have corosync installed and talking between a couple of machines, you may wish to move on to installing [[Pacemaker]].
