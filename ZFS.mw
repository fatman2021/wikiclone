'''ZFS'''  is an advanced [[filesystem]] and was developed by SUN Microsystems.

== Features ==
ZFS includes many features like:
* Manage storage hardware as ''vdevs'' in ''zpools''
* Manage volumes in ''zpools'' (like [[LVM]])
* Redundancy with support for RAIDZ1 (RAID5), RAIDZ2 (RAID6) and MIRROR (RAID1)
* Resilvering file system
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication Data deduplication]
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression Data compression] with zle ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding zero-length encoding] — fast, but only compresses sequences of zeros), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZJB LZJB] or its replacement [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_%28compression_algorithm%29 LZ4], or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip gzip] (higher compression, but slower)
* Snapshots (like differential backups)
* NFS export of volumes

== Installation ==

=== Modules ===
There are out-of-tree Linux kernel modules available from the [http://www.zfsonlinux.org/ ZFSOnLinux Project]. The current release is version 0.6.1 (zpool version 28). This Version is the first release which is considered to be [http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/ZFS-on-Linux-is-ready-for-wide-scale-deployment-1832848.html "ready for wide scale deployment on everything from desktops to super computers"], by the ZFSOnLinux Project.
{{Note|All changes to the GIT repository are subject to regression tests by [https://www.llnl.gov// LLNL].}}
To install ZFS on Gentoo Linux requires '''~amd64''' keyword for {{Package|sys-fs/zfs}} and it's dependencies {{Package|sys-fs/zfskmod}} and {{Package|sys-fs/spl}}:
{{RootCmd|echo "sys-kernel/spl ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
|echo "sys-fs/zfs-kmod ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
|echo "sys-fs/zfs ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
|emerge -av zfs}}
The latest upstream versions require keywording the live ebuilds (optional):
{{RootCmd|echo "{{=}}sys-kernel/spl-9999 **" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
|echo "{{=}}sys-fs/zfs-kmod-9999 **" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
|echo "{{=}}sys-fs/zfs-9999 **" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
}}
Add zfs to the boot runlevel to mount all zpools on boot:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add zfs boot}}

=== USE flags ===
{{USEflag
|package=sys-fs/zfs
|custom-cflags++no
|rootfs+yes+yes
|static-libs++no
|test-suite++no
}}

=== Tweak ===
Per default ZFS uses as much memory as available for its [[Wikipedia:Adaptive replacement cache|ARC]] cache. It should not be less than 512MB and a good value is 1/4 of available memory. This property can only be set during module loading, to restrict how much memory should be used to 512MB:
{{RootCmd|echo "options zfs zfs_arc_max{{=}}536870912" >> /etc/modprobe.d/zfs.conf}}

== Installing into the kernel directory (for static installs) ==
This example uses 9999, but just change it to the latest ~ or stable (when that happens) and you should be good.
The only issue you may run into is having zfs and zfs-kmod out of sync with eachother.  Just try to avoid that :D

This will generate the needed files, and copy them into the kernel sources directory.

{{RootCmd|env EXTRA_ECONF='--enable-linux-builtin' ebuild /usr/portage/sys-kernel/spl/spl-9999.ebuild clean configure
|(cd /var/tmp/portage/sys-kernel/spl-9999/work/spl-9999 && ./copy-builtin /usr/src/linux)
|env EXTRA_ECONF='--with-spl=/usr/src/linux --enable-linux-builtin' ebuild /usr/portage/sys-fs/zfs-kmod/zfs-kmod-9999.ebuild clean configure
|(cd /var/tmp/portage/sys-fs/zfs-kmod-9999/work/zfs-kmod-9999/ && ./copy-builtin /usr/src/linux)}}

After this, you just need to edit the kernel config to enable CONFIG_SPL and CONFIG_ZFS and emerge the zfs binaries.

{{RootCmd|mkdir -p /etc/portage/profile
|echo 'sys-fs/zfs -kernel-builtin' >> /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask
|echo 'sys-fs/zfs kernel-builtin' >> /etc/portage/package.use
|emerge -1v sys-fs/zfs}}

The echo's only need to be run once, but the emerge needs to be run every time you install a new version of zfs.

== Usage ==
ZFS includes already all programs to manage the hardware and the file systems, there are no additional tools needed.

=== Preparation ===
To go through the different commands and scenarios we can create virtual hard drives using loopback devices.<br/>
First we need to make sure the loopback module is loaded. If you want to play around with partitions, use the following option:
{{RootCmd|modprobe -r loop
|modprobe loop max_part{{=}}63}}
{{Note|You cannot reload the module, if it is built into the kernel.}}
The following commands create 2GB image files in /var/lib/zfs_img/ that we use as our hard drives (uses ~8GB disk space):

{{RootCmd|mkdir /var/lib/zfs_img
|dd if{{=}}/dev/null of{{=}}/var/lib/zfs_img/zfs0.img bs{{=}}1024 seek{{=}}2097152
|dd if{{=}}/dev/null of{{=}}/var/lib/zfs_img/zfs1.img bs{{=}}1024 seek{{=}}2097152
|dd if{{=}}/dev/null of{{=}}/var/lib/zfs_img/zfs2.img bs{{=}}1024 seek{{=}}2097152
|dd if{{=}}/dev/null of{{=}}/var/lib/zfs_img/zfs3.img bs{{=}}1024 seek{{=}}2097152}}
Now we check which loopback devices are in use:
{{RootCmd|losetup -a}}
We assume that all loopback devices are available and create our hard drives:
{{RootCmd|losetup /dev/loop0 /var/lib/zfs_img/zfs0.img
|losetup /dev/loop1 /var/lib/zfs_img/zfs1.img
|losetup /dev/loop2 /var/lib/zfs_img/zfs2.img
|losetup /dev/loop3 /var/lib/zfs_img/zfs3.img}}
We have now /dev/loop[0-3] as four hard drives available
{{Note|On the next reboot, all the loopback devices will be released and the folder /var/lib/zfs_img can be deleted}}

=== Zpools ===
The program /usr/sbin/zpool is used with any operation regarding ''zpools''.

==== import/export Zpool ====
To export (unmount) an existing zpool named ''zfs_test'' into the file system, you can use the following command:
{{RootCmd
|zpool export zfs_test
|zpool status
}}
To import (mount) the zpool named ''zfs_test'' use this command:
{{RootCmd
|zpool import zfs_test
|zpool status
}}
The root mountpoint of ''zfs_test'' is a property and can be changed the same way as for volumes.
To import (mount) the zpool named ''zfs_test'' root on /mnt/gentoo, use this command:
{{RootCmd
|zpool import -R /mnt/gentoo zfs_test
|zpool status
}}
{{Note|ZFS will automatically search on the hard drives for the zpool named ''zfs_test''}}

==== One Hard Drive ====
Create a new zpool named ''zfs_test'' with one hard drive:
{{RootCmd|zpool create zfs_test /dev/loop0}}
The zpool will automatically be mounted, default is the root file system aka /zfs_test
{{RootCmd|zpool status}}
To delete a zpool use this command:
{{RootCmd|zpool destroy zfs_test}}
{{Important|ZFS will not ask if you really want to}}

==== MIRROR Two Hard Drives ====
In ZFS you can have several harddrives in a MIRROR, where equal copies exist on each storage. This increases the performance and redundancy. To create a new zpool named ''zfs_test'' with two hard drives as MIRROR:
{{RootCmd|zpool create zfs_test mirror /dev/loop0 /dev/loop1}}
{{Note|of the two hard drives only 2GB are effective useable so ''total_space * 1/n''}}
{{RootCmd|zpool status}}
To delete the zpool:
{{RootCmd|zpool destroy zfs_test}}

==== RAIDZ1 Three Hard Drives ====
RAIDZ1 is the equivalent to RAID5, where data is written to the first two drives and a parity onto the third. You need at least three hard drives, one can fail and the zpool is still ONLINE but the faulty drive should be replaced as soon as possible.<br/>
To create a pool with RAIDZ1 and three hard drives:
{{RootCmd|zpool create zfs_test raidz1 /dev/loop0 /dev/loop1 /dev/loop2}}
{{Note|of the three hard drives only 4GB are effective useable so ''total_space * (1-1/n)''}}
{{RootCmd|zpool status}}
To delete the zpool:
{{RootCmd|zpool destroy zfs_test}}

==== RAIDZ2 Four Hard Drives ====
RAIDZ2 is the equivalent to RAID6, where data is written to the first two drives and a parity onto the next two. You need at least four hard drives, two can fail and the zpool is still ONLINE but the faulty drives should be replaced as soon as possible.<br/>
To create a pool with RAIDZ2 and four hard drives:
{{RootCmd|zpool create zfs_test raidz2 /dev/loop0 /dev/loop1 /dev/loop2 /dev/loop3}}
{{Note|of the four hard drives only 4GB are effective useable so ''total_space * (1-2/n)''}}
{{RootCmd|zpool status}}
To delete the zpool:
{{RootCmd|zpool destroy zfs_test}}

==== Spares/Replace vdev ====
You can add ''hot-spares'' into your zpool. In case a failure, those are already installed and available to replace faulty vdevs.
In this example, we use RAIDZ1 with three hard drives and a zpool named ''zfs_test'':
{{RootCmd|zpool add zfs_test spare /dev/loop3
|zpool status}}
The status of /dev/loop3 will stay AVAIL until it is set to be ''online'', now we let /dev/loop0 fail:
{{RootCmd
|zpool offline zfs_test /dev/loop0
|zpool status
|output=<pre>NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
zfs_test    DEGRADED     0     0     0
  raidz1-0  DEGRADED     0     0     0
    loop0   OFFLINE      0     0     0
    loop1   ONLINE       0     0     0
    loop2   ONLINE       0     0     0
spares
  loop3     AVAIL
</pre>}}
We replace /dev/loop0 with our spare /dev/loop3:
{{RootCmd
|zpool replace zfs_test /dev/loop0 /dev/loop3
|zpool status
|output=<pre>pool: zfs_test
 state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices has been taken offline by the administrator.
        Sufficient replicas exist for the pool to continue functioning in a
        degraded state.
action: Online the device using 'zpool online' or replace the device with
        'zpool replace'.
 scrub: resilver completed after 0h0m with 0 errors on Sun Aug 21 22:29:22 2011
config:

        NAME         STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        zfs_test     DEGRADED     0     0     0
          raidz1-0   DEGRADED     0     0     0
            spare-0  DEGRADED     0     0     0
              loop0  OFFLINE      0     0     0
              loop3  ONLINE       0     0     0  46.5K resilvered
            loop1    ONLINE       0     0     0
            loop2    ONLINE       0     0     0
        spares
          loop3      INUSE     currently in use

errors: No known data errors
</pre>}}
{{Note|the file system got automatically resilvered onto /dev/loop3 and the zpool was all the time online}}
Now we remove the failed vdev /dev/loop0 and start a manual scrubbing:
{{RootCmd
|zpool detach zfs_test /dev/loop0 && zpool scrub
|zpool status
|output=<pre>pool: zfs_test
 state: ONLINE
 scrub: scrub completed after 0h0m with 0 errors on Sun Aug 21 22:37:52 2011
config:

        NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        zfs_test    ONLINE       0     0     0
          raidz1-0  ONLINE       0     0     0
            loop3   ONLINE       0     0     0
            loop1   ONLINE       0     0     0
            loop2   ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors
</pre>}}

==== Zpool Version Update ====
With every update of {{Package|sys-fs/zfs}}, you are likely to also get a more recent ZFS version. Also the status of your zpools will indicate a warning that a new version is available and the zpools could be upgraded.<br/>
To display the current version on a zpool:
{{RootCmd|zpool upgrade -v
|output=<pre>This system is currently running ZFS pool version 28.

{{Warning|systems with a lower version installed will not be able to import a zpool of a higher version}}
To upgrade the version of zpool ''zfs_test'':
{{RootCmd|zpool upgrade zfs_test}}
To upgrade the version of all zpools in the system:
{{RootCmd|zpool upgrade -a}}

==== Zpool Tips/Tricks ====
* You cannot shrink a zpool and remove vdevs after it's initial creation.
* It is possible to add more vdevs to a MIRROR after it's initial creation. Use the following command (/dev/loop0 is the first drive in the MIRROR):
{{RootCmd|zpool attach zfs_test /dev/loop0 /dev/loop2}}
* More than 9 vdevs in one RAIDZ could cause performance regression. For example it is better to use 2xRAIDZ with each five vdevs rather than 1xRAIDZ with 10 vdevs in a zpool
* RAIDZ1 and RAIDZ2 cannot be resized after intial creation (you can only add additional hot spares). You can however replace the hard drives with bigger ones (one at a time), e.g. replace 1T drives with 2T drives to double the available space in the zpool.
* It is possible to mix MIRROR, RAIDZ1 and RAIDZ2 in a zpool. For example a zpool with RAIDZ1 named zfs_test, to add two more vdevs in a MIRROR use:
{{RootCmd|zpool add -f zfs_test mirror /dev/loop4 /dev/loop5}}
{{Note|this needs the -f option}}
* It is possible to restore a destroyed zpool, by reimporting it straight after the accident happened:
{{RootCmd|zpool import -D
|output=<pre>  pool: zfs_test
    id: 12744221975042547640
 state: ONLINE (DESTROYED)
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.</pre>}}
{{Note|the option -D searches on all hard drives for existing zpools}}

=== Volumes ===
The program /usr/sbin/zfs is used with any operation regarding ''volumes''. To control the size of a volume you can set quota and you can reserver a certain amount of storage within a zpool, per default the complete storage size in the zpool is used.

==== Create Volumes ====
We use our zpool ''zfs_test'' to create a new volume called ''volume1'':
{{RootCmd|zfs create zfs_test/volume1}}
The volume will be mounted automatically as /zfs_test/volumes1/
{{RootCmd|zfs list}}

==== Mount/Umount Volumes ====
Volumes can be mounted with the following command, the mountpoint is defined by the property ''mountpoint'' of the volume:
{{RootCmd|zfs mount zfs_test/volume1}}
To unmount the volume:
{{RootCmd|zfs unmount zfs_test/volume1}}
The folder /zfs_test/volume1 stays without the volume behind it. If you write data to it and then try to mount the volume again, you will see the following error message:
{{Code||cannot mount '/zfs_test/volume1': directory is not empty}}

==== Remove Volumes ====
To remove volumes ''volume1'' from zpool ''zfs_test'':
{{RootCmd
|zfs destroy zfs_test/volume1
|zfs list
}}
{{Note|you cannot destroy a volume if there exist any snapshots of it}}

==== Properties ====
Properties for volumes are inherited from the zpool. So youy can either change the property on the zpool for all volumes or specific for each volume individual or a mix of both.<br/>
To set a property for a volume:
{{RootCmd|zfs set <property> zfs_test/volume1}}
To show the setting for a particular property on a volume:
{{RootCmd|zfs get <property> zfs_test/volume1}}
{{Note|The properties are used on a volume e.g. compression, the higher is the version of this volume}}
You can get a list of all properties set on any zpool with the following command:
{{RootCmd|zfs get all}}
This is a partial list of properties that can be set on either zpools or volumes, for a full list see ''man zfs'':
{| class=wikitable
|- 
| Property
| Value
| Function
|-
| quota=
| 20m,none
| set a quota of 20MB for the volume
|-
| reservation=
| 20m,none
| reserves 20MB for the volume within it's zpool
|-
| compression=
| zle,gzip,on,off
| uses the given compression method or the default method for compression which should be gzip
|-
| sharenfs=
| on,off,ro,nfsoptions
| shares the volume via NFS
|-
| exec=
| on,off
| controls if programs can be executed on the volume
|-
| setuid=
| on,off
| controls if SUID or GUID can be set on the volume
|-
| readonly=
| on,off
| sets read only atribute to on/off
|-
| atime=
| on,off
| update access times for files in the volume
|-
| dedup=
| on,off
| sets deduplication on or off
|-
| mountpoint=
| none,path
| sets the mountpoint for the volume below the zpool or elsewhere in the file system, a mountpoint set to ''none'' prevents the volume from being mounted
|}

==== Set Mountpoint ====
Set the mountpoint for a volume, use the following command:
{{RootCmd|zfs set mountpoint{{=}}/mnt/data zfs_test/volume1}}
The volume will be automatically moved to /mnt/data

==== NFS Volume ====
Create a volume as NFS share:
{{RootCmd|zfs create -o sharenfs{{=}}on zfs_test/volume2}}
Check what file systems are shared via NFS:
{{RootCmd|exportfs}}
Per default the volume is shared to all networks, to specify share options:
{{RootCmd
|zfs set sharenfs{{=}}"-maproot{{=}}root -alldir -network 192.168.1.254 -mask 255.255.255.0" zfs_test/volume2
|exportfs
}}
To stop sharing the volume:
{{RootCmd
|zfs set sharenfs{{=}}off zfs_test/volume2
|exportfs
}}

=== Snapshots ===
Snapshots are volumes which have no initial size and save changes made to another volume. With increasing changes between the snapshot and the original volume it grows in size.

===== Create Snapshots =====
To create a snapshot of a volume, use the following command:
{{RootCmd|zfs snapshot zfs_test/volume1@22082011}}
{{Note|''volume1@22082011'' is the full name of the snapshot, everything after the @ symbol can be any alphanumeric combination}}
Every time a file in ''volume1'' changes, the old data of the file will be linked into the snapshot.

===== List Snapshots =====
List all available snapshots:
{{RootCmd|zfs list -t snapshot -o name,creation}}

===== Rollback Snapshots =====
To rollback a full volume to a previous state:
{{RootCmd|zfs rollback zfs_test/volume1@21082011}}
{{Note|if there are other snapshots in between, then you have to use the -r option. This would remove all snapshots between the one you want to rollback and the original volume}}

===== Clone Snapshots =====
ZFS can clone snapshots to new volumes, so you can access the files from previous states individually:
{{RootCmd|zfs clone zfs_test/volume1@21082011 zfs_test/volume1_restore}}
In the folder /zfs_test/volume1_restore can now be worked on in the version of a previous state

===== Remove Snapshots =====
Remove snapshots of a volume with the following command:
{{RootCmd|zfs destroy zfs_test/volume1@21082011}}

=== Maintenance ===

==== Scrubbing ====
Start a scrubbing for zpool ''zfs_test'':
{{RootCmd|zpool scrub zfs_test}}
{{Note|this might take some time and is quite I/O intensive}}

==== Log Files ====
To check the history of commands that were executed:
{{RootCmd|zpool history}}

==== Monitor I/O ====
Monitor I/O activity on all zpools (refreshes every 6 seconds):
{{RootCmd|zpool iostat 6}}
