== Configuration ==
This section explains how to setup a simple NFS server - NFS client configuration. 
The NFSv4 server configuration is mostly like configuring the version 3, with one major change all NFS shares are exported from one virtual root directory.

The server has 2 NFS shares which are: 
* {{Path|/export/home}} - directory with user homes
* {{Path|/export/data}} - directory with example data

These 2 shares are mounted on the server system at following points in the tree:
{{Cmd|df -h {{!}} egrep 'File{{!}}home{{!}}data'|output=<pre>
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdb1        20G  977M   19G   5% /home
/dev/sdc1       200G   91G  110G  46% /data
</pre>}}

The client uses now TCP protocol as default, to mount NFS shares. Previous NFS versions use UDP as the default protocol.

=== Linux ===
Verify if NFS version 4 is enabled in current running linux kernel, this has to be ensured on the server as well as on the client installations:

{{RootCmd|cd /usr/src/linux}}
{{RootCmd|make nconfig}}

{{Kernel||<pre>
File systems  --->
   Network File Systems  --->
      <*>   NFS client support
      [*]     NFS client support for NFS version 4
      <*>   NFS server support
      [*]     NFS server support for NFS version 4 (EXPERIMENTAL)
</pre>}}

{{Note|NFS server support is not needed on a NFS client installation, also NFS client support is not necessarily needed on a NFS server.}}
Optionally NFSv4 support could be build as a kernel module. After NFSv4 support has been enabled, new linux kernel needs to be build, installed and the system has to be restarted.

=== Server ===

==== /export ====
A virtual NFS root directory needs to be created:
{{RootCmd|cd /}}
{{RootCmd|mkdir export}}
{{Note|You can substitute the name and the location of the virtual root (here: {{Path|/export}}), with anything else f.e. {{Path|/nfsroot}} or {{Path|/home/NFSv4root}}.}}

Create 2 directories in the {{Path|/export}} directory for NFS shares:
{{RootCmd|cd /export && mkdir {home,data} }}

==== NFS shares ====
Mount the shares to its mount points:
{{RootCmd|mount --bind /home /export/home && mount --bind /data /export/data}}

Add following two lines to [[fstab]], so NFS shares will still be available after a system reboot:
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
[...]
/home    /export/home   none    bind  0  0
/data    /export/data   none    bind  0  0
[...]
</pre>}}

====/etc/exports====
NFS shares are configured in {{Path|/etc/exports}} file. This file has following structure:
<pre>
source1         target1(option1,option2)
source2         target2(option1,option3)
</pre>
*'''source''' : is a directory the virtual root itself or particular nfs exported share f.e. {{Path|/export/home}}.
*'''target''' : single host f.e. ''larrysPC'' , or a network ''192.168.0.0/28'', or a wildcard like f.e. ''*'' which means here it can be accessed from all networks by all hosts on all interfaces.
For '''options''' consult following table:
{| class="wikitable"
|+{{Path|/etc/exports}} options
|-
!Option
!Explanation
|- 
| ro || '''default''' the directory is shared read only; the client machine will not be able to write it.
|-
| rw || The client machine will have read and write access to the directory.
|-
| no_root_squash || If no_root_squash is selected, then root on the client machine will have the same level of access to the files on the system as root on the server. This can have serious security implications. '''You should not specify this option without a good reason'''.
|-
| no_subtree_check || If only part of a volume is exported, a routine called subtree checking verifies that a file that is requested from the client is in the appropriate part of the volume. If the entire volume is exported, disabling this check will speed up transfers. 
|-
| sync || By '''default'''. It is possible to switch to '''async'''.
|-
| insecure || Tells the NFS server to use unprivileged ports (ports above 1024). This may be needed to allow mounting the NFS share from MacOS X or through the nfs:/ kioslave in KDE.
|-
| fsid=0 || NFS sever identifies each file system that it exports with a digit, for the NFSv4 server there is a virtual root filesystem which is the root of all exported file systems. This root is identified with '''fsid=0'''.
|}

Specify the virtual root {{Path|/export}} as the first entry, then define specific shares, in this particular case the file will look like in the example below:

{{File|/etc/exports||<pre>
/export                 192.168.0.0/24(rw,fsid=0,no_subtree_check)
/export/home            192.168.0.0/24(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check)
/export/data            192.168.0.0/24(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check)
</pre>}}
{{Note|Substitute the target network used in this example (''192.168.0.0/24'') with your own network}}

==== /etc/conf.d/nfs ====
To provide NFSv4 protocol access only, specify which version of the NFS protocol the server has to use ''-V 4'' and which versions are not supported ''-N 3 -N 2''  in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/nfs}} file
{{File|/etc/conf.d/nfs||<pre>
[...]
# Options to pass to rpc.mountd
# ex. OPTS_RPC_MOUNTD="-p 32767"
OPTS_RPC_MOUNTD="-V 4 -N 3 -N 2"
[...]
</pre>}}
{{Important|To provide NFS version 3 support additionally, think of building a linux module.}}

==== Starting service daemon ====
Finally start the configured NFS daemon:
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/nfs start
|output=<pre>
 * Starting rpcbind ...                                                                            [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS statd ...                                                                          [ ok ]
 * Starting idmapd ...                                                                             [ ok ]
 * Use of the opts variable is deprecated and will be
 * removed in the future.
 * Please use extra_commands, extra_started_commands or extra_stopped_commands.
 * Exporting NFS directories ...                                                                   [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS mountd ...                                                                         [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS daemon ...                                                                         [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS smnotify ...                                                                       [ ok ]
</pre>}}

As shown many services are started in specific order, ''rpcbind'' is started as the first service. 
If there is a need to stop the NFS service, the easiest way to stop all NFS services at once is to stop the '''rpcbind''' service itself. 

It command will shutdown each service shown in the upper starting routine example: 
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/rpcbind stop}}

Add nfs to a runlevel, to be able to use it after a reboot:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add nfs default
|output=<pre>
* service nfs added to runlevel default
</pre>}}

=== Client ===

==== Mounting remote directories ====
Before mounting remote directories 2 daemons should be be started first:
* rpcbind
* rpc.statd

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/rpc.statd start
|output=<pre>
 * Starting rpcbind ...                                                   [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS statd ...                                                 [ ok ]
</pre>}}

The directories can be mounted with following command:
{{RootCmd|mount server:/home /home}}
{{Note|substitute the name ''server'' with the IP address or DNS name of your own NFS server}}

==== Mounting at boot time ====
Add NFS shares to the {{Path|/etc/fstab}} file. 
* 1st option is to mount the NFS virtual root including all exported shares at once:
{{Important|The {{Path|/export}} directory, server exported virtual root is recognized as a root of a file system on the client side, which is simply a "/" in the example below. This is a different approach compared to NFSv3}}
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
[...]
server:/         /mnt     nfs     rw,_netdev,auto   0  0
</pre>}}

* or the 2nd option is to define each NFS share individually, to have the ability to mount them to different local mount point:
{{File|/etc/fstab||<pre>
[...]
server:/home      /home     nfs     rw,_netdev,auto   0  0
server:/data      /data     nfs     rw,_netdev,auto   0  0
</pre>}}

Finally start the nfsmount service
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/nfsmount start
|output=<pre>
 * Starting rpcbind ...                                                   [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS statd ...                                                 [ ok ]
 * Starting idmapd ...                                                    [ ok ]
 * Starting NFS sm-notify ...                                             [ ok ]
 * Mounting NFS filesystems ...                                           [ ok ]
</pre>}}

Add nfsmount to the default startup level
{{RootCmd|rc-update add nfsmount default}}

At this point the NFS shares should be mounted on the client. It can be verified with following command:
{{Cmd|netstat -tn {{!}} egrep '2049{{!}}Active{{!}}Pro'
|output=<pre>
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0      0 192.168.0.10:997        192.168.0.1:2049        ESTABLISHED
</pre>
}}

Or run just:
{{Cmd|df -h}}
