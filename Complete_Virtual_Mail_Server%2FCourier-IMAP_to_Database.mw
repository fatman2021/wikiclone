== Introduction ==
Courier-IMAP will be used to provide both [[Wikipedia:Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] and [[Wikipedia:Post Office Protocol|POP3]] services. Many will be interested in IMAP as POP3 is not being used as much anymore. This is quite understandable as IMAP has many advantages.

The major difference between POP3 and IMAP would be that IMAP keeps messages on the server whereas with POP3, the client retrieves the messages and are then gone from the server. Having the messages kept on server allows for several clients to actively work with the same mailbox from different locations. The most basic example would be webmail and a desktop client, both accessing the same mailbox at the same time. Also in general, webmail clients strongly favor IMAP. The price this comes with of course, is primarily disk space and processing power on your server. With disk space being as cheap as it is these days, 32Gb set aside pure for e-mail offers a lot of space for mails, at hardly any cost. And if processing power is an issue, which are generally used by server-side based searches, they could be disabled.

This chapter will mainly focus on IMAP, but will include POP3 for completeness sake. Some research into the two protocols may be required if the choice is not so certain.

== Installing Courier-IMAP ==
{{Package|net-mail/courier-imap}} has a few useflags that need to be examined. {{Package|net-libs/courier-authlib}} is an important dependency as it is responsible for how users authenticate, so it's useflags are examined aswell.

{{USEflag|package=net-libs/courier-authlib
|ldap++yes
|postgres++yes
|mysql++yes
|vpopmail++no
}}
Only choose the desired database backends.
{{Warning|libauth*sql.so may not be built if you do not enable -vpopmail and do not have vpopmail installed. Vpopmail and libauth*sql.so do not mix.}}

{{USEflag
|fam++yes
|ipv6++yes
}}
{{Note|The ''fam'' USE flag is required for the IDLE (e.g. 'push') function to work.}}

If the proper USE flags are set, emerging courier-imap should pull in courier-authlib.

=== Configuring courier-authlib ===

==== Postgres ====
Courier-authlib runs as root, so access to the socket will be permitted by default.
{{Note|Only fields that should be changed are listed here. There are two commented options. ''PGSQL_HOST'' obviously as mentioned before, unix sockets will be used. ''PGSQL_QUOTA_FIELD'' is commented for now, as quotas will be enabled at a later stage. The ''PGSQL-UID_FIELD'', ''PGSQL-GID_FIELD'' and ''PGSQL_HOME_FIELD'' (Note the trailing slash!) are set to static values, noticeable as they are quoted. Thus static values, not from a database are used.}}
{{File|/etc/courier/authlib/authpgsqlrc|Obtain access to the database|<pre>
##NAME: LOCATION:0
# PGSQL_HOST		pgsql.example.com
PGSQL_PORT		5432
PGSQL_USERNAME		postfix
PGSQL_PASSWORD		$password

##NAME: PGSQL_DATABASE:0
PGSQL_DATABASE		postfix

##NAME: PGSQL_USER_TABLE:0
PGSQL_USER_TABLE	mailbox

##NAME: PGSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD:0
PGSQL_CRYPT_PWFIELD	password

##NAME: PGSQL_UID_FIELD:0
PGSQL_UID_FIELD		'5000'

##NAME: PGSQL_GID_FIELD:0
PGSQL_GID_FIELD		'5000'

##NAME: PGSQL_LOGIN_FIELD:0
PGSQL_LOGIN_FIELD	local_part

##NAME: PGSQL_HOME_FIELD:0
PGSQL_HOME_FIELD	'/var/vmail/'

##NAME: PGSQL_NAME_FIELD:0
PGSQL_NAME_FIELD	name

##NAME: PGSQL_MAILDIR_FIELD:0
PGSQL_MAILDIR_FIELD	maildir

##NAME: PGSQL_QUOTA_FIELD:0
# PGSQL_QUOTA_FIELD	quota

##NAME: PGSQL_WHERE_CLAUSE:0
# Deal only with active mail accounts.
PGSQL_WHERE_CLAUSE      active='1'
</pre>}}
If logins via ''user@domain.com'' instead of ''username'', the value of PGSQL_LOGIN_FIELD needs to be changed from '''local_part''' to '''username'''.

To use more advanced authentication SQL statement the PGSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE can be used. Courier-authlib will ignore any of the previous set parameters for SELECT statements, but will use them for counting the number of accounts or for changing the password and thus when changing the password the username field is still used. If authentication is done against username remember that usernames need to be unique.
{{File|/etc/courier/authlib/authpgsqlrc|Obtain custom access to the database|<pre>
PGSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE	SELECT local_part, password, '', '5000', '5000',	\
			'/var/vmail/', maildir, quota, name, ''		 	\
			FROM mailbox WHERE local_part='$(local_part)'	 	\
			AND active='1'
</pre>}}

=== Configuring authdaemon ===
Authdaemon is actually responsible for doing the authentication. Here it needs to be configured which database backend needs to be used. Portage actually does set the '''authmodulelist''' variable properly. Verify this in the configuration file. Also enable debugging here.
{{File|/etc/courier/authlib/authdaemonrc|Verify authentication modules|<pre>
##NAME: authmodulelist:2
authmodulelist="authpgsql "

##NAME: DEBUG_LOGIN:0
DEBUG_LOGIN=1
</pre>}}
{{Note|Obviously if more or others authmodules are desired, these should be listed here also.}}

=== Access permissions ===
Permissions must be set correctly, as the files can contain sensitive password information.
{{RootCmd|chmod 660 /etc/courier/authlib/auth*rc|chown mail:mail /etc/courier/authlib/auth*rc}}

=== Testing courier-authlib ===
Courier-authlib includes a simple testing utility. At its least it requires a valid username as parameter. Don't hesitate to
{{Cmd|man authtest}}
for details. The man page is short but concise. 

To perform some basic tests start the authlib daemon with 
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/courier-authlib start}} 
and run ''authtest'' on the your testuser.
{{RootCmd|authtest testuser|output=<pre>
Authentication succeeded.

     Authenticated: testuser  (uid 5000, gid 5000)
    Home Directory: /var/vmail
           Maildir: example.com/testuser/
             Quota: (none)
Encrypted Password: $1$16117118$ajxN3QRilmP5zLVHjTkE31
Cleartext Password: (none)
           Options: (none)
</pre>}}

== Configuring POP3/IMAP ==

=== POP3 ===
POP3 requires little configuring to get working. It is however recommended to skip this section and not enable/use pop3 and thus leave this setting at '''NO'''. A user may be able to remove all messages that where supposed to be stored on the server for imap usage, then incorrectly configure his mail client and purge the server of his mailbox this way.
{{File|/etc/courier-imap/pop3|Enable pop3|<pre>
##NAME: POP3DSTART:0
POP3DSTART=YES
</pre>}}

=== IMAP ===
IMAP has a few ''capabilities'' that can be enabled.
* '''SORT''' to allow server side searching through messages.
* '''IDLE''' to allow 'push' like connections.
{{File|/etc/courier-imap/imapd|Enable imapd and some options|<pre>
##NAME: IMAP_CAPABILITY:1
IMAP_CAPABILITY="IMAP4rev1 UIDPLUS CHILDREN NAMESPACE THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT THREAD=REFERENCES SORT QUOTA IDLE"

##NAME: IMAP_CHECK_ALL_FOLDERS:0
IMAP_CHECK_ALL_FOLDERS=1

##NAME: IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE:0
IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE=1

##NAME: IMAP_EMPTYTRASH:0
IMAP_EMPTYTRASH=Trash:40,Junk:7

##NAME: IMAPDSTART:0
IMAPDSTART=YES

##NAME: MAILDIRPATH:0
MAILDIR=.maildir
MAILDIRPATH=.maildir
</pre>}}
{{Note|The ''MAILDIRPATH'' section contains some dupes, make sure it is properly set- and cleaned-up.}}

== Testing IMAP/POP3 ==

=== POP3 ===
Courier-pop3d should be started.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/courier-pop3d start}}
Once started, telnet should be used to identify initial problems. Once logging in with telnet works, a mail client can be used.
{{Cmd|telnet foo.example.com 110|output=<pre>
+OK Hello there.
user testuser
+OK Password required
Pass secret
+OK logged in
</pre>}}
{{Note|This is the first time the password is used in plain text. It was previously only known as $1$16117118$ajxN3QRilmP5zLVHjTkE31.}}
If testing works properly, add courier-pop3d to the default runlevel.
{{RootCmd|rc-update add courier-pop3d default}}

=== IMAP ===
Courier-imapd should be started.
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/courier-imapd start}}
Once started, telnet should be sed to identify initial problems. Once logging in with telnet works, a mail client can be used.
{{Cmd|telnet foo.example.com 143|output=<pre>
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to foo.example.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 UIDPLUS CHILDREN NAMESPACE THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT THREAD=REFERENCES SORT IDLE ACL ACL2=UNION STARTTLS] Courier-IMAP ready. Copyright 1998-2008 Double Precision, Inc.  See COPYING for distribution information.
1 LOGIN testuser secret 
1 OK LOGIN Ok.
1 LOGOUT
* BYE Courier-IMAP server shutting down
1 OK LOGOUT completed
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>}}

If testing works properly, add courier-imap to the default runlevel.
{{RootCmd|rc-update add courier-imapd default}}

== Wrapping things up ==
Turn off debugging if this stage works properly.
{{File|/etc/courier/authlib/authdaemonrc|Disable debugging|<pre>
##NAME: DEBUG_LOGIN:0
DEBUG_LOGIN=0
</pre>}}
