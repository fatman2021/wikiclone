The '''Compose key''', also known as ''Multi_key'' on the X Window System, allows one to combine several keys into one character (e.g. {{key|compose}} {{key|o}} {{key|/}} to form ø, or {{key|compose}} {{key|{{=}}}} {{key|e}} to form €).

There is no compose key defined by default. The user can specify it in XkbOptions, or through graphical front-ends such as {{package|x11-misc/qxkb}}.
