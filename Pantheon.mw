'''Pantheon''' is a new lightweight, modular desktop environment primarily written in Vala and GTK+, for the [http://elementaryos.org/ elementary OS] project.

== Installation ==
{{Warning|The ''elementary'' [[overlay]] is undergoing rapid development, and these instructions are subject to rapid change.}}

Pantheon currently resides in the elementary overlay. You will first need to ensure you have [[layman]] installed. Then you will need to add the ''elementary'' overlay.

{{RootCmd|layman -a elementary}}

Next, we need to add the ~arch keyword to allow installation. At the time of writing only ~amd64 is supported. After keywording pantheon-base/pantheon, portage will give instructions for all dependent packages that also require a keyword. A list of required keyword changes is supplied below.

You should ensure that X is included in your global [[USE flag]]s. Beyond that, I've added a list of other necessary USE flags to install pantheon:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||<pre>
sys-fs/udev gudev
sys-auth/consolekit policykit
sys-auth/pambase consolekit
dev-libs/libxml2 python
=x11-libs/gdk-pixbuf-2.26.1 jpeg
</pre>}}

There were also a few packages that were hard-masked in portage. These will need to be unmasked for now:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.mask||<pre>
=media-libs/cogl-1.10.4
=media-libs/clutter-1.10.8
</pre>}}

Now, you should be able to emerge pantheon:
{{Emerge|pantheon-base/pantheon}}

== Minimal Installation ==
The <tt>pantheon</tt> meta-package pulls in most of the available packages. It might however be wise to start a little smaller. This can be done by emerging just the <tt>pantheon-shell</tt> and then select the elementary applications you want to give a try:
{{Emerge|pantheon-base/pantheon-shell}}

And then for example just emerge Audience and Pantheon Terminal:
{{Emerge|media-video/audience x11-terms/pantheon-terminal}}

== Reporting Issues ==
As mentioned in the beginning, the elementary overlay is undergoing rapid development, just like the upstream elementary OS project. This means that things might break, or do not work properly yet. If you discover any issues, or if you want to contribute, just create a [https://github.com/pimvullers/elementary/issues/new new issue] on the [https://github.com/pimvullers/elementary elementary overlay] Github project or contact the [mailto:elementary@vullersmail.nl maintainer].
