This package can be used to search for files (or strings) provided by packages that are not yet installed, and optionally installs a little cronjob to update the database on the internet with the information that is available to be queried.

== Installation ==
You can install {{Package|app-portage/pfl}} with the following command:
{{Emerge|app-portage/pfl}}

=== USE Flags ===
{{USEflag
|package=app-portage/pfl
|network-cron+yes+yes+
}}

== Usage ==
The database can be used online to search for files installed by ebuilds. Lets say you want to run ''glxgears'' but it isn't installed. Recently the program was removed from ''mesa'' itself, so you could search for glxgears online to find the related package: [http://www.portagefilelist.de/site/query/file search online]
