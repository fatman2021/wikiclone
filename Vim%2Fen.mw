'''Vim''' ('''V'''i '''im'''proved) is a text editor based on [[Wikipedia:Vi|vi]]. It can be used from the command line or as a standalone application with graphical user interface.

== Installation ==

=== Application installation ===

To install Vim with both the ncurses-based interface (for the terminal - {{Path|/usr/bin/vim}}) and the graphical interface (for the X Window System - {{Path|/usr/bin/gvim}}), install {{Package|app-editors/gvim}}:

{{Emerge|app-editors/gvim}}

There is also an experimental [[Qt]] interface called {{Package|app-editors/vim-qt}}.

If the X Window System support is not needed, just install {{Package|app-editors/vim}}:

{{Emerge|app-editors/vim}}

=== Extensions ===

The category ''app-vim'' provides a lot of additional syntax definitions, plugins and other Vim related stuff.

Use <code>emerge</code> or <code>eix</code> to get an overview of available packages in the ''app-vim'' category:

{{Cmd|emerge --search "%@^app-vim"
|eix -cC app-vim}}

== Using Vim ==

=== Getting started ===

Vim has a built-in tutorial which should require around 30 min to go through. Start it using the <code>vimtutor</code> command:

{{Cmd|vimtutor}}

== Tips and Tricks ==

=== Using Vim like ex or ed from the command line ===

It is possible to use Vim for one-liners - commands that can be used in scripts or on the command line to make changes in an unattended manner.

For instance, the following command adds <code>#</code> to the beginning of each line in the {{Path|file.txt}} file:

{{Cmd|vim -c ":%s/^/#/g" -c ":x" file.txt}}

What happens is that Vim interprets the passed on commands (through the <code>-c</code> option). The first command is Vim's substitution command (which is very similar to <code>sed</code>'s), the second one is Vim's instruction to save and exit the editor.

=== Change file encoding ===

To change the file encoding of a file to [[UTF-8]], use the following command (in Vim command mode):

{{Cmd|e ++enc{{=}}utf8|prompt=:|color=blue}}

As shown in the previous trick, it is possible to do this from the command line as well:

{{Cmd|vim -c ":wq! ++enc{{=}}utf8" file.txt}}
