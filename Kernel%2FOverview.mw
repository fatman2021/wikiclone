<!--T:1-->
This document provides an overview on all kernel sources that Gentoo provides through Portage.

== Introduction == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
As with everything else in Gentoo Linux, the philosophy of the Gentoo Kernel team is to give the user as much freedom of choice as possible. When looking at the output of <kbd>emerge -s sources</kbd> it is easy to see a large variety of kernels to choose from. This document will attempt to give a brief rundown of the goals of each of the patch sets that Gentoo provides and also explain other kernel sources that are available.

== Supported kernel packages == <!--T:4-->

=== Genkernel === <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
<kbd>genkernel</kbd> is a kernel toolset that can be used to autodetect hardware and configure the kernel automatically. This is usually recommended for users who do not feel comfortable about compiling a kernel manually. 

<!--T:7-->
For more information, please read the [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/genkernel.xml Gentoo Linux Genkernel Guide] . 

=== General purpose: gentoo-sources === <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
For most users, the {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} kernel is recommended. gentoo-sources is a kernel based on Linux 3.x, lightly patched to fix security problems, kernel bugs, and to increase compatibility with the more uncommon system architectures. 

<!--T:10-->
The {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} package absorbs most of the resources of the Gentoo kernel team. They are brought to the user by a group of talented developers, which can count on the expertise of popular kernel hacker Greg Kroah-Hartman, maintainer of udev and responsible for the USB and PCI subsystems of the official Linux kernel. 

=== For servers: hardened-sources === <!--T:11-->

<!--T:12-->
The {{Package|sys-kernel/hardened-sources}} kernel is based on the official Linux kernel and is targeted at users running Gentoo on server systems. It provides patches for the various sub-projects of Gentoo Hardened (such as support for [http://selinuxproject.org/ SELinux] and [http://grsecurity.net grsecurity]), together with stability and security-enhancements. Check [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/ http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/] for more information. 

<!--T:13-->
{{Important|This kernel provides powerful patches for enhanced security. Please read the [http://www.gentoo.org//proj/en/hardened/ documentation] before using it.}}

=== ck-sources === <!--T:14-->

<!--T:15-->
{{Package|sys-kernel/ck-sources}} is Con Kolivas's kernel patch set. This patchset is primarily designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity and is configurable for varying workloads (from servers to desktops). The patchset includes a different scheduler, BFS, designed to keep systems responsive and smooth even when under heavy load. Support and information is available at [http://kernel.kolivas.org http://kernel.kolivas.org] and in the <code>#ck</code> channel on [http://irc.oftc.net irc.oftc.net].

=== git-sources === <!--T:16-->

<!--T:17-->
The {{Package|sys-kernel/git-sources}} package tracks daily snapshots of the upstream development kernel tree. These kernels are good for users interested in kernel development or testing. Bug reports should go to the [http://bugzilla.kernel.org/ Linux Kernel Bug Tracker] or LKML (Linux Kernel Mailing List). 

=== Architecture dependent kernels === <!--T:18-->

<!--T:19-->
{{Package|sys-kernel/mips-sources}} and {{Package|sys-kernel/xbox-sources}} are, as their names suggest, patched to run best on specific architectures. They also contain some of the patches for hardware and features support from the other patch sets mentioned above and below. 

== Unsupported kernel packages == <!--T:20-->

<!--T:21-->
Now to briefly describe some of the other {{Path|sys-kernel/*-sources}} which scrolled by when the <kbd>emerge -s sources</kbd> command was run. Below we discuss each one of them individually. These kernels are provided as a courtesy only — the various patch sets are not supported by the Gentoo kernel team. There is no specific preference to one source or another, so we review the kernel sources in alphabetical order.

=== aufs-sources === <!--T:77-->

<!--T:78-->
The {{Package|sys-kernel/aufs-sources}} package contains full kernel sources including the official genpatchset (found in gentoo-sources) for the 3.1x kernel tree and aufs3 support. This kernel is useful when attempting to utilize the aufs3 filesystem. For more information see the aufs3 page on [http://aufs.sourceforge.net/ Sourceforge] or the [http://dev.gentoo.org/~mpagano/genpatches/index.htm genpatches homepage].

=== pf-sources === <!--T:22-->

<!--T:23-->
The {{Package|sys-kernel/pf-sources}} kernel brings together parts of several different kernel patches. It includes the BFS patchset from {{Package|sys-kernel/ck-sources}}, the {{Package|sys-kernel/tuxonice-sources}} patches, [http://www.linuximq.net LinuxIMQ], and the [http://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/patches/ BFQ] I/O [http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Budget_Fair_Queuing_IO_Scheduler scheduler]. 

=== openvz-sources === <!--T:24-->

<!--T:25-->
OpenVZ is a server virtualization solution built on Linux. OpenVZ creates isolated, secure virtual private servers (VPSs) or virtual environments on a single physical server enabling better server utilization and ensuring that applications do not conflict. For more information, see [http://www.openvz.org http://www.openvz.org]. 

=== tuxonice-sources === <!--T:26-->

<!--T:27-->
The {{Package|sys-kernel/tuxonice-sources}} (formerly <tt>sys-kernel/suspend2-sources</tt>) are patched with both genpatches which includes the patches found in gentoo-sources, and the patches found in [http://www.tuxonice.net TuxOnIce] which are an improved implementation of suspend-to-disk for the Linux kernel, formerly known as ''suspend2''. 

<!--T:28-->
This kernel is recommended for laptop users who often rely on being able to suspend their laptop and resume work elsewhere. 

=== usermode-sources === <!--T:29-->

<!--T:30-->
usermode-sources are the User Mode Linux kernel patches and can be found in the {{Package|sys-apps/usermode-utilities}} package. These kernel patches are designed to allow Linux to recursively run within Linux. User Mode Linux is intended for testing and virtual server support. For more information about this amazing tribute to the stability and scalability of Linux, see [http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net]. 

<!--T:31-->
For more information on UML and Gentoo, read the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User-mode_Linux/System_testing_with_UML Gentoo UML Guide].

=== vanilla-sources === <!--T:32-->

<!--T:33-->
Many Linux users will probably be familiar with the {{Package|sys-kernel/vanilla-sources}} package. These kernels are copies of the official kernel sources released on [http://www.kernel.org/ http://www.kernel.org/]. Please note that the Gentoo kernel team does not patch vanilla-sources at all; they are purely for people who wish to run a completely unmodified Linux kernel. The Gentoo kernel team recommends {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} instead. 

<!--T:34-->
Versions of the kernel can be found under this package: 3.x.

== Previously provided kernel packages == <!--T:35-->

=== aa-sources === <!--T:36-->

<!--T:37-->
<tt>aa-sources</tt> was a heavily modified kernel with all kinds of patches. The upstream maintainer stopped releasing kernel patchsets and subsequently this package has been removed. 

=== alpha-sources === <!--T:38-->

<!--T:39-->
<tt>alpha-sources</tt> was a 2.4 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the Alpha architecture. These patches have been developed and are now included in the mainline kernel. Alpha users can run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== Architecture dependent kernels === <!--T:40-->

<!--T:41-->
<tt>cell-sources</tt> was a 2.6 kernel designed to run on the Sony PlayStation 3 game console. 

=== development-sources === <!--T:42-->

<!--T:43-->

=== gentoo-dev-sources === <!--T:44-->

<!--T:45-->
<tt>gentoo-dev-sources</tt> , a 2.6 kernel patched with bug, security, and stability fixes, can now be found under the [[Kernel/Overview#gentoo-sources|gentoo-sources]] package. 

=== grsec-sources === <!--T:46-->

<!--T:47-->
The <tt>grsec-sources</tt> kernel source used to be patched with the latest grsecurity updates (grsecurity version 2.0 and up) which included, amongst other security-related patches, support for PaX. Grsecurity patches are included in the [[Kernel/Overview#hardened-sources|hardened-sources]] kernel, so this package is no longer available in Portage. 

=== hardened-dev-sources === <!--T:48-->

<!--T:49-->
<tt>hardened-dev-sources</tt> can now be found under the [[Kernel/Overview#hardened-sources|hardened-sources]] package. 

=== hppa-sources === <!--T:50-->

<!--T:51-->
<tt>hppa-sources</tt> was a 2.6 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the HPPA architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. HPPA users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== mm-sources === <!--T:52-->

<!--T:53-->
The <tt>mm-sources</tt> were based on [[Kernel/Overview#vanilla-sources|vanilla-sources]] and contained Andrew Morton's patch set. They included the experimental and bleeding-edge features that were going to be included in the official kernel (or were going to be rejected because they set systems on fire!). They were known to be always moving at a fast pace and could change radically from one week to the other; kernel hackers often used <tt>mm-sources</tt> as a testing ground for highly experimental stuff. They have since been removed from the Portage tree.

=== rsbac-dev-sources === <!--T:54-->

<!--T:55-->
The <tt>rsbac-dev-sources</tt> kernels can now be found under the {{Package|sys-kernel/rsbac-sources}} package. 

=== rsbac-sources === <!--T:56-->

<!--T:57-->
Back in the days of 2.6-based kernels {{Package|sys-kernel/rsbac-sources}} contained patches to use Rule Set Based Access Controls ([http://www.rsbac.org RSBAC] ). It was removed due to lack of maintainers, but has has magically reappeared with the 3.10 kernel series. Use [[Kernel/Overview#hardened-sources|hardened-sources]] if additional security features are needed.

=== selinux-sources === <!--T:58-->

<!--T:59-->
<tt>selinux-sources</tt> , a 2.4 kernel including lots of security enhancements, has been obsoleted by security development in the 2.6 kernel tree. SELinux functionality can be found in the [[Kernel/Overview#hardened-sources|hardened-sources]] package. 

=== sh-sources === <!--T:60-->

<!--T:61-->
<tt>sh-sources</tt> was a 2.6 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the SuperH architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. SuperH users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches. 

=== sparc-sources === <!--T:62-->

<!--T:63-->
<tt>sparc-sources</tt> was a 2.4 kernel with patches applied to improve hardware compatibility for the SPARC architecture. These patches have been developed and included in the mainline kernel. SPARC users can now run any recent kernel with no need for extra patches.

=== uclinux-sources === <!--T:64-->

<!--T:65-->
The <tt>uclinux-sources</tt> are meant for CPUs without MMUs as well as embedded devices. For more information, see [http://www.uclinux.org http://www.uclinux.org]. Lack of security patches as well as hardware to test on were the reasons this package is no longer found in the Portage tree. 

=== win4lin-sources === <!--T:66-->

<!--T:67-->
<tt>win4lin-sources</tt> were patched to support the userland win4lin tools that allowed Linux users to run many Microsoft Windows (TM) applications at almost native speeds. These kernel sources were removed due to security issues. 

=== xen-sources === <!--T:68-->

<!--T:69-->
<tt>xen-sources</tt> was a 2.6-based kernel that allowed running multiple operating systems on a single physical system. A user could create virtual environments in which one or more guest operating systems could run on a [http://www.xensource.com Xen]-powered host operating system. 

<!--T:70-->
The <tt>xen-sources</tt> patches were incorporated into the mainline Linux kernel as of version 3.0. 

<!--T:71-->
For more information on working with Xen and Gentoo, read the [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/xen-guide.xml Gentoo Xen Guide]. 

=== zen-sources === <!--T:72-->

<!--T:73-->
The {{Package|sys-kernel/zen-sources}} package is designed for desktop systems. It includes code not found in the mainline kernel. The Zen kernel has patches that add new features, support additional hardware, and contains various tweaks for desktops. The Zen 3.8 kernel series is currently masked in the Portage tree. For more information on the Zen kernel please visit [http://zen-kernel.org Zen Kernel Live Sources website].
