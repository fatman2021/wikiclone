This article describes the setup of a Windows guest using [[QEMU]].

== Host ==
To create a disk image for the virtual machine, run:
{{Cmd|qemu-img create -f qcow2 WindowsVM.img 15G}}

Download Windows driver image from [http://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/virtio-win/latest/images/bin/ http://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/virtio-win/latest/images/bin/].

Since QEMU requires a lot of [[QEMU/Options|options]], it would be a good idea to put them into a shell script, e.g.:
{{FileBox|filename=WindowsVM|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
exec qemu-kvm \
        -cpu host \
        -drive file=WindowsVM.img,if=virtio \
        -net nic -net user,hostname=windowsvm \
        -m 1G \
        -monitor stdio \
        -name Windows \
        "$@"
}}

Change the path to your disk image ''WindowsVM.img'' in the script. You can additional options when calling the script. To boot the disk image, run:
{{Cmd|./WindowsVM -boot d -drive file{{=}}WINDOWS.iso,media{{=}}cdrom -drive file{{=}}DRIVER.iso,media{{=}}cdrom}}

Install the Windows guest. See the [[#Guest|guest section]] for optimum support. After the installation start the script without the additional options.

{{Note|When upgrading to QEMU 1.3 you have to add the option "-enable-kvm" to keep your guest responsive. You also need to change "-net nic" to "-net nic,model{{=}}rtl8139" to have a network interface in your guest.}}
{{Note|When upgrading to QEMU 1.5.3 you have to add "-display sdl,frame{{=}}off,window_close{{=}}off" to keep your fullscreen session full screen. Without this option I got a (new) menubar at the top of the screen, pushing the Windows bottom menu off screen.}}

{{Note| When upgrading to QEMU 2.0.0 replace qemu-kvm with qemu-system-CPUTYPE (e.g. qemu-system-x86_64); the qemu-kvm wrapper has been removed - see {{Bug|506566}} }}

* During installation at the partition step Windows doesn't detect the VirtIO hard drive. You have to tell Windows to use the ''viostor'' driver from the driver image.

* After installation Windows doesn't for the VirtIO ethernet adapter. You have to tell Windows to use the ''netkvm'' driver from the driver image.

* For 32 bit Windows 7 a sound driver for the [http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Sound Intel 82801AA AC97] exists. 

* For 64 bit Windows 7 Intel hda is available as an option (qemu option: '... -soundhw hda ...')

* USB 2.0 pass through can be configured from host to guest with variations of: '... -usb -device usb-ehci,id=ehci -device usb-host,bus=ehci.0,vendorid=1452 ...'

[[QEMU]] with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE_%28protocol%29 SPICE] support enable (among other things) the more powerful QXL display device and makes clipboard sharing possible (copy/paste between clients and the virtual machine).

To use SPICE with [[QEMU]] enable the following '''USE''' flags
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=Setting USE variable|1=
app-emulation/qemu   spice
app-emulation/spice  client
}}
and build '''qemu''':
{{RootCmd|emerge app-emulation/qemu}}

=== Guest ===

On Windows guests you need to install [http://www.spice-space.org/download.html Windows guest tools].

=== Running qemu ===

To run [[QEMU]] from a script, e.g.:
{{FileBox|filename=WindowsVM|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
SPICE_PORT=5924
qemu-kvm -daemonize \
    -cpu host \
    -drive file=WindowsVM.img,if=virtio \
    -net nic -net user,hostname=windowsvm \
    -m 1G \
    -vga qxl \
    -spice port=${SPICE_PORT},disable-ticketing \
    -usbdevice tablet \
    -device virtio-serial \
    -chardev spicevmc,id=vdagent,name=vdagent \
    -device virtserialport,chardev=vdagent,name=com.redhat.spice.0 \
    "$@"
exec spicec --title Windows -h 127.0.0.1 -p ${SPICE_PORT}
}}
