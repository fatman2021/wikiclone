This document covers the installation and maintenance of printers using CUPS and Samba. It covers local installation and networked installations and contains instructions on using shared printers from other operating systems.

== Printing and Gentoo Linux ==

=== Use the Right Tools ===

Linux has great support for printers; the right tool for the job is called CUPS ([http://www.cups.org Common Unix Printing System]). Since the beginning of the project, back in 1999, the installation and maintenance of CUPS has improved dramatically. 

In this document we will cover how to use CUPS to setup a local or networked printer. It will not go in too much detail since the project has [http://www.cups.org/documentation.php great documentation] available for advanced usage. 

== カーネルの設定 ==

=== はじめに ===

When a user desires to install a printer on a system the first step is knowing how the printer will be attached to the system. Is it through a local port like LPT or USB, or is it networked? If it is networked, does it use the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) or the Microsoft Windows CIFS protocol (Microsoft Windows Sharing)? 

The next few sections explain what minimal kernel configuration needed to get a printer connected in Gentoo. Of course, this depends on ''how'' the printer is going to be attached to the system, so for convenience the instructions have been separated.

Navigate to {{Path|/usr/src/linux}} and run <kbd>make menuconfig</kbd> to enter the kernel configuration. If <kbd>genkernel</kbd> was used to configure the kernel, these steps should still be performed to make sure nothing was missed. Do not rely on genkernel to configure everything in the system automatically; printing is an area configuration settings are difficult to automatically set.

In the next configuration examples, the necessary support will be added ''into'' the kernel, not as modules. Building the kernel this way is not mandatory; if desired modular support can be easily added, just be sure to remember to load the appropriate modules! 

Now go to the appropriate section to configure (or check) the kernel.

=== Locally Attached Printer (LPT) ===

The LPT port is generally used to identify the parallel printer port. You need to enable parallel port support first, then PC-style parallel port support (unless using a SPARC system) after which you enable parallel printer support. 

{{KernelBox|title=Parallel Port Printer Configuration|<pre>
Device Drivers -->
  <*> Parallel port support
  <*> PC-style hardware
  [*] IEEE 1284 transfer modes
  Character Devices -->
    <*> Parallel printer support
</pre>
}}

{{Note|Some users might may to enable other options in the <code>Parallel port support</code> section. Check the kernel configuration <code>Help</code> function for more information.}}

That's it! Exit the kernel configuration and rebuild the kernel using the following command:

{{RootCmd|make && make modules_install}}

Do not forget to copy the newly compiled kernel image to the {{Path|/boot}} location. If applicable mount {{Path|/boot}}, and update the boot loader configuration prior to rebooting the system. For instance, when using GRUB2, these steps can be done by running the following commands:

{{RootCmd|mount /boot}}
{{RootCmd|make install}}
{{RootCmd|grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub.grub.cfg}}

Now continue with CUPS.

=== Locally Attached Printer (USB) ===

To print via USB, USB support must be enabled in the kernel: 

{{KernelBox|title=USB ポート接続のプリンターの設定|<pre>
Device Drivers -->
  USB Support -->
    <*> Support for Host-side USB
    (...)
    --- USB Host Controller Drivers
    (Select the HCD that your system uses. If you do not know which one
     to select, run "lspci -v | grep HCI" from another terminal)
    <*> EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support ( or )
    <*> OHCI HCD support           ( or )
    <*> UHCI HCD (most Intel and VIA) support
</pre>
}}

Exit the kernel configuration and rebuild the kernel. Do not forget to copy the new kernel image to the {{Path|/boot}} location (if necessary mount the {{Path|/boot}} partition before copying the kernel) and update the boot loader configuration prior to rebooting the system. Note the root commands listed in the '''LPT Printer Configuration''' step above for how to perform these steps.

Now continue with CUPS.

=== Remotely Attached Printer (IPP) ===

To be able to connect to a remotely attached printer through the Internet Printing Protocol the kernel needs to have networking support. Assuming the kernel has that already, continue with CUPS. 

=== Remotely Attached Printer (CIFS) ===

The kernel must support CIFS: 

{{KernelBox|title=CIFS Printer Configuration|<pre>
File systems -->
  Network File Systems -->
    <*> CIFS support (advanced network filesystem, SMBFS successor) 
</pre>
}}

After configuration for CIPS is complete, exit the kernel configuration and rebuild the kernel. Do not forget to copy the new kernel image to the {{Path|/boot}} location (and don't forget to mount {{Path|/boot}} if needed) and update the boot loader configuration prior to rebooting the system. Note the root commands in the '''LPT Printer Configuration''' step above for how to perform these steps.

Now continue with CUPS.

== Installing and Configuring CUPS ==

=== インストール ===

Installing CUPS with Gentoo is a breeze. CUPS has a few optional features that might be of interest. To enable or disable those features, use the '''USE''' flags associated with them.

{{USEflag|package=net-print/cups
|X+++Allows the user to use a desktop menu to load the CUPS configuration webpage into a preferred browser.
|dbus+++Adds support for the <code>dbus</code> system message bus.
|pam+++If print job authentication through the Pluggable Authentication Modules is needed, this will activate PAM support for CUPS.
|ssl+++If remote authentication and/or privacy is required support for the Secure Socket Layer must be enabled which will allow for encrypted printing sessions. Support for SSL must be available on all participating systems on the network.
|usb+++Support for working with printers connected via USB.
}}

Check the current '''USE''' flag settings. To deviate from the current USE settings for CUPS alone, add the appropriate USE flags to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} file. 

{{RootCmd|emerge -pv cups|output=<pre>
[ebuild N     ] net-print/cups-1.7.3  USE="X acl dbus pam ssl threads usb -debug -gnutls -java -kerberos -lprng-compat -python (-selinux) -static-libs -systemd -xinetd -zeroconf" ABI_X86="(64) (-32) (-x32)" LINGUAS="ca es fr it ja pt_BR ru" PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET="python2_7" PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7" 0 kB
</pre>}}

When happy with the result, have Portage install CUPS. 

{{Emerge|cups}}

To enable SAMBA support, {{Package|net-fs/samba}} needs to be installed with CUPS support. Update the {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}} file or directory to enable the <code>cups</code> '''USE''' flag:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=samba で、cups の USE フラグを有効にする|1=<pre>
net-fs/samba cups
</pre>}}

Then (re)install Samba:

{{Emerge|net-fs/samba}}

{{Important|Any user that needs to print should be added to the <code>lp</code> group:
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a username lp}}
  
In order to be able to add printers and edit them via CUPS's web interface, any system user that is allowed to edit these settings should be in the <code>lpadmin</code> group:
  
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a username lpadmin}}
}}

If the printer is attached to the system locally, and the printer needs to be available every boot, the CUPS daemon will need to load automatically on start-up. Make sure the printer is attached and powered on before the CUPS daemon is started. 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/cupsd start
|rc-update add cupsd default}}

=== 設定 ===

The default CUPS server configuration located in {{Path|/etc/cups/cupsd.conf}} is sufficient for most users. However, some users might need to make changes to the CUPS configuration.

In the next section covers a few changes that are often needed: 

* Allow other systems to use the printer attached to this Linux workstation.
* Grant access to the CUPS administration from remote systems.
* Configure CUPS to support Windows PCL drivers. This is advised for Windows systems to be able to use a SAMBA-shared printer since most Windows drivers are PCL drivers.
* Configure this system to use a printer attached to another system (not Windows share).

=== Remote Printer Access ===

For other systems to use the printer through IPP, explicit access to the printer must be granted in the {{Path|/etc/cups/cupsd.conf}} file. To share the printer using SAMBA, this change is not needed. 

Open up {{Path|/etc/cups/cupsd.conf}} in a favorite text editor and add in an <code>Allow</code> line for the system(s) that should be able to reach to the printer. In the next example, access is granted to the printer from localhost and from any system whose IP address starts with <code>192.168.0</code>. 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/cups/cupsd.conf|title=Allowing remote access to the printer|1=<pre>
<Location />
  Order allow,deny
  Allow localhost
  Allow from 192.168.0.*
</Location>
</pre>}}

This line broadcasts browsing information to the clients on the network; it will let network users know when the printer is available:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/cups/cupsd.conf|title=Broadcast info|1=<pre>
BrowseAddress 192.168.0.*:631
</pre>
}}

The port CUPS listens to will also need to be specified so that it will respond to printing requests from other machines on the network:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/cups/cupsd.conf|title=Port configuration|1=<pre>
Listen *:631
#Listen localhost:631
</pre>
}}

{{Note|If using CUPS 1.1 (which is now deprecated), a different syntax is required for remote printing requests:
{{CodeBox|title=Deprecated CUPS 1.1 configuration|<pre>
Port 631
(Make sure the next two lines are commented out)
#Listen 127.0.0.1:631
#Listen localhost:631
</pre>
}}
}}

=== CUPS Remote Administration ===

If remote administration is needed, then access to the CUPS administration will need to be granted from more systems than the localhost. Edit the {{Path|/etc/cups/cupsd.conf}} file and have explicit access granted to each system that requires access. For instance, to grant access to a system with an IP address of 192.168.0.3: 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/cups/cupsd.conf|title=Allowing remote access|1=pre>
<Location /admin>
(...)
  Encryption Required
  Order allow,deny
  Allow localhost
  Allow 192.168.0.3
</Location>
</pre>
}}

Do not forget to restart the CUPS daemon after making changes to {{Path|/etc/cups/cupsd.conf}} by issuing the <kbd>/etc/init.d/cupsd restart</kbd> command. 

=== Enable Support for Windows PCL Drivers ===

PCL drivers send raw data to the print server. To enable raw printing on CUPS, edit {{Path|/usr/share/cups/mime/mime.types}} and uncomment the <code>application/octet-stream</code> line if it is not already uncommented. Then edit {{Path|/usr/share/cups/mime/mime.convs}} and do the same, if it is not already uncommented. 

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/cups/mime/mime.types|title=raw 印刷サポートを有効にする|1=<pre>
application/octet-stream
</pre>}}

{{FileBox|filename=/usr/share/cups/mime/mime.convs|1=<pre>
application/octet-stream     application/vnd.cups-raw    0    -
</pre>
}}

Do not forget to restart the CUPS daemon after making these changes by running <kbd>/etc/init.d/cupsd restart</kbd>. 

=== Setting Up a Remote Printer ===

If the printers are attached to a remote CUPS-powered server the system can be easily configured to use the remote printer by modifying the {{Path|/etc/cups/client.conf}} file. 

Assuming the printer is attached to a system called <code>printserver.mydomain</code>, open up {{Path|/etc/cups/client.conf}} with a favorite text editor and set the <code>ServerName</code> directive: 

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/cups/client.conf|1=<pre>
# (printserver.mydomain を、あなたのプリントサーバー名に置き換えてください)
ServerName printserver.mydomain
</pre>
}}

The remote system will have a default printer setting which will be used. To change the default printer, use the <kbd>lpoptions</kbd> command.

First list the available printers:

{{RootCmd|lpstat -a|output=<pre>
hpljet5p accepting requests since Jan 01 00:00
hpdjet510 accepting requests since Jan 01 00:00
</pre>}}

Set the HP LaserJet 5P as the default printer:

{{RootCmd|lpoptions -d hpljet5p}}

== プリンターを設定する ==

=== はじめに ===

If the printer to be configured is remotely available through a different print server (running CUPS) then the following instructions are not needed. Instead, read [[#Setting_Up_a_Remote_Printer|Setting Up a Remote Printer]]. 

=== プリンターの検出 ===

If a USB printer or parallel port printer was powered on when the Linux system booted, it might be possible to retrieve information from the kernel stating successful detection of the printer. This is merely an indication of print detection and not a requirement. 

{{Cmd|dmesg {{!}} grep -i print|output=<pre>
parport0: Printer, Hewlett-Packard HP LaserJet 2100 Series
</pre>}}

For a USB printer:

{{Cmd|lsusb|output=<pre>
(...)
Bus 001 Device 007: ID 03f0:1004 Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 970c/970cse
</pre>
}}

=== Installing the Printer ===

To have the printer installed on the system, fire up a browser and point it to [http://localhost:631 http://localhost:631]. The CUPS web interface should be displayed from which all administrative tasks can be performed. 


{{Note|If an HTTPS connection to CUPS is used the first time the interface is accessed it ''may'' take a very long time before the page appears. This is because the first request triggers the generation of CUPS SSL certificates which can be a time-consuming job.}}

Go to {{Path|Administration}} and enter the root login and password information of the box. Then, when the administrative interface has been reached, click on {{Path|Add Printer}}. A new screen will be displayed allowing the following information to be entered: 

* The ''spooler name'', a short but descriptive name used on the system to identify the printer. This name should not contain spaces or any special characters. For instance, for the HP LaserJet 5P could be titled <code>hpljet5p</code>.
* The ''location'', a description where the printer is physically located (for instance "bedroom", or "in the kitchen right next to the dish washer", etc.). This is to aid in maintaining several printers.
* The ''description'' should contain a full description of the printer. A common use is the full printer name (like "HP LaserJet 5P").

The next screen requests the device the printer listens to. The choice of several devices will be presented. The next table covers a few possible devices, but the list is not exhaustive.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left;" 
|- 
! Device
! Description
|- 
| AppSocket/HP JetDirect
| This special device allows for network printers to be accessible through a HP JetDirect socket. Only specific printers include support for this option.
|- 
| Internet Printing Protocol (IPP or HTTP)
| Used reach the remote printer through the IPP protocol either directly (IPP) or through HTTP.
|- 
| LPD/LPR Host or Printer
| Select this option if the printer is remote and attached to a LPD/LPR server.
|- 
| Parallel Port #1
| Select when the printer is locally attached to a parallel port (LPT). When the printer is automatically detected its name will be appended to the device.
|- 
| USB Printer #1
| Select when the printer is locally attached to a USB port. The printer name should automatically be appended to the device name.
|-
|}

If installing a remote printer, the URL to the printer will be queried: 

* An LPD printer server requires a <code>lpd://hostname/queue</code> syntax.
* An HP JetDirect printer requires a <code>socket://hostname</code> syntax.
* An IPP printer requires a <code>ipp://hostname/printers/printername</code> or <code><nowiki>http://hostname:631/printers/printername</nowiki></code> syntax.

Next, select the printer manufacturer in the adjoining screen along with the model type and number in the subsequent screen. For many printers multiple drivers will be available. Select one now or search on [http://www.openprinting.org/printer_list.cgi OpenPrinting Printer List] for a good driver. Drivers are easily able to be changed later. 

Once the driver is selected, CUPS will inform that the printer has been added successfully to the system. Navigate to the printer management page on the administration interface and select {{Path|Configure Printer}} to change the printer's settings (resolution, page format, ...).

=== Testing and Reconfiguring the Printer ===

To verify if the printer is working correctly, go to the printer administration page, select the printer and click on {{Path|Print Test Page}}. 

If the printer does not seem to work correctly, click on {{Path|Modify Printer}} to reconfigure the printer. The same screens as during the first installation will appear but the defaults will now be the current configuration. 

If the printer does not function, clues may be found by looking at the CUPS error log located at {{Path|/var/log/cups/error_log}} In the next example a permission error is discovered, probably due to a wrong {{Path|Allow}} setting in the {{Path|/etc/cups/cupsd.conf}} file.

{{RootCmd|tail /var/log/cups/error_log|output=<pre>
(...)
E [11/Jun/2005:10:23:28 +0200] [Job 102] Unable to get printer status (client-error-forbidden)!
</pre>
}}

=== Installing the Best Driver ===

Many printer drivers exist; to find out which one has the best performance the job, visit the [http://www.openprinting.org/printer_list.cgi OpenPrinting Printer List]. Select the brand and type/model of the printer to find out what driver the site recommends. For instance, for the HP LaserJet 5P, the site recommends the <code>ljet4</code> driver. 

Download the PPD file from the site and place it in {{Path|/usr/share/cups/model}} then run <kbd>/etc/init.d/cupsd restart</kbd> as root. This will make the driver available through the CUPS web interface. Now reconfigure the printer as described above.

== Using Special Printer Drivers ==

=== はじめに ===

Some printers require specific drivers or provide additional features that are not enabled through the regular configuration process (described above). This chapter will discuss a selection of printers and how they are made to work with Gentoo Linux. 

=== Gutenprint Driver ===

The [http://gutenprint.sourceforge.net gutenprint] drivers are high-quality, open source printer drivers for various Canon, Epson, HP, Lexmark, Sony, Olympus and PCL printers supporting CUPS. They also support ghostscript, The Gimp, and other applications. 

Gentoo's Portage tree contains an ebuild for the gutenprint drivers. Run <kbd>emerge gutenprint</kbd> to install them. Note the ebuild requests to quite a few '''USE''' flags. At minimum <code>cups</code> and <code>ppds</code> must enabled for gutenprint drivers to work properly.

{{Emerge|gutenprint}}

When the emerge process has finished, the gutenprint drivers will be available through the CUPS web interface.

=== HPLIP Driver ===

See [[HPLIP|HPLIP Driver]].

=== PNM2PPA Driver ===

PPA is an HP technology that focuses on sending low-level processing to the system instead of the printer which makes the printer cheaper but more resource consuming. 

If the [http://www.openprinting.org/printer_list.cgi OpenPrinting] site informs the [http://pnm2ppa.sourceforge.net/ pnm2ppa] driver is the best option, then the <code>pnm2ppa</code> filter will need to be installed on the system: 

{{Emerge|pnm2ppa}}

Once installed, download the PPD file for the printer [http://www.openprinting.org/printer_list.cgi OpenPrinting] and put it in the {{Path|/usr/share/cups/model}} folder. Then configure the printer using the steps explained above.

== Printing From and To Microsoft Windows ==

{{Note|You should read the [[Samba/HOWTO|Samba/CUPS Guide]] for more detailed information on setting up CUPS with Samba.}}

=== Configuring a Windows Client for IPP ===

Microsoft Windows supports IPP (Windows 9x and ME users need to [http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;294439 install] it separately). To install a printer on Windows that is attached to a Linux box, fire up the {{Path|Add Printer}} wizard and select {{Path|Network Printer}}. When asked for the URI, use the <code><nowiki>http://hostname:631/printers/queue</nowiki></code> syntax. 

=== Configuring a Windows Client for a Samba Shared Printer ===

To share the printer on the CIFS network SAMBA must be installed and configured correctly. Doing this is beyond the scope of this article, however a quick configuration of SAMBA for shared printers will be covered. 

Open {{Path|/etc/samba/smb.conf}} with a favorite text editor and add a <code>[printers]</code> section to it: 

{{CodeBox|title=[printers] セクション|1=<pre>
[printers]
  comment      = All printers
  path         = /var/spool/samba
  browseable   = no
  guest ok     = no
  writable     = no
  printable    = yes
  public       = yes
  printer name = hpljet5p
</pre>
}}

Navigate to the top of the {{Path|smb.conf}} file until inside the <code>[global]</code> section. Locate the <code>printcap name</code> and <code>printing</code> settings and set each of them to <code>cups</code> (see the example below):

{{CodeBox|title=Changing the [global] section of smb.conf|1=<pre>
[global]
  (...)
  printcap name = cups
  printing      = cups
</pre>
}}

Make sure to enable [[#Enable_Support_for_Windows_PCL_Drivers|windows pcl]] support in CUPS. Then, restart the smb service to have the changes take effect.

=== Configuring a Linux Client for a Windows Print Server ===

First make sure the printer is shared on Windows systems and that <code>samba</code> has been emerged with the <code>cups</code> '''USE''' flag enabled (as instructed above).

To find the desired printer's URI, run the following command, substituting <code>server</code> with the computer that is to probe for samba-shared printers:

{{Cmd|smbclient -N '\\server\'}}

In the CUPS web interface, configure the printer as previously described. Notice CUPS has added another driver called <code>Windows Printer via SAMBA</code>. Select it and use the <code>smb://username:password@workgroup/server/printername</code> or <code>smb://server/printername</code> syntax for the URI.

{{Important|Any special characters in the above URI need to be appropriately quoted. For example:
<code>smb://BEN-DESKTOP/HP Color LaserJet CP1510 series PCL6</code>
  
becomes:
  
<code>smb://BEN-DESKTOP/HP%20Color%20LaserJet%20CP1510%20series%20PCL6</code>
  
  
This result string can be obtained by running the following command:
{{Cmd|python2 -c 'import urllib; print "smb://" + urllib.quote("BEN-DESKTOP/HP Color LaserJet CP1510 series PCL6")'}}
}}

== Printing-related Applications ==

=== はじめに ===

Many tools exist to help configure a printer, use additional printing filters, add features to printing capabilities, etc. This chapter will list a few of them. Be aware the list is not exhaustive and not meant to discuss each tool in great detail. 

=== Gtk-LP - A Gtk-powered Printer Configuration Tool ===

With [http://gtklp.sourceforge.net/index.shtml Gtk-LP] installation, modification and configuration of a printer can be performed from a stand-alone Gtk application. It uses CUPS and provides all standard CUPS capabilities. It is definitely worth checking out if the CUPS Web interface is disliked or if a stand-alone application for day-to-day printing routines is desired. 

インストールするには、 gtklp を emerge します:

== トラブルシューティング ==

=== Error: Unable to convert file 0 to printable format ===

While having printing troubles and {{Path|/var/log/cups/error_log}} shows this message: 

{{CodeBox|title=エラーログ|1=<pre>

}}

Re-emerge {{Package|app-text/ghostscript-gpl}} with the <code>cups</code> '''USE''' flag. You can either add <code>cups</code> to the system '''USE''' flags in {{Path|/etc/portage/make.conf}} or enable it only for ghostscript-gpl as shown: 

{{RootCmd|echo "app-text/ghostscript-gpl cups" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

Then run <kbd>emerge app-text/ghostscript-gpl</kbd>. When it has finished compiling, be sure to restart <code>cupsd</code> afterward: 

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/cupsd restart}}
