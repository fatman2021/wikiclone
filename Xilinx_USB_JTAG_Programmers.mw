''' Special Note: Following wiki is addressed towards Digilent Xilinx USB JTAG cables (There is Xilinx XUP-USB-JTAG cable as well)'''

Assuming you have installed the Xilinx installation, this article will guide you on installing Cable Drivers for Xilinx USB JTAB Programmers. If you have problems, please check that you have not done any misstake on the primary installation.

=== Getting what's needed ===
First of all, this guide assumes you have installed Xilinx ISE (version 13.4 is used here) into the default path of /opt/Xilinx
Next, you will need to have GIT installed to get the required libraries. This approach does not use the official Xilinx libraries but a replica of them. You will also need libusb which is required in the compiling of the drivers. On a 64-bit host, you will need to get bin86 and dev86 packages.

=== Digilent Adept Runtime x86/x64 ===
Digilent Adept Runtime package is available at [http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,66,828&Prod=ADEPT2 Digilent] website.

Chose the package according to your linux OS. If it’s a 32-bit OS, dowload Adept Runtime x86 Linux. If it’s 64-bit kernel, download Adept Runtime x64 Linux. The downloaded software package is wrapped in format .tar.gz.

=== Digilent Adept Utilities x86/x64 ===
Digilent Adept Runtime package is available at [http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,66,828&Prod=ADEPT2 Digilent] website.

Chose the package according to your linux OS. If it’s a 32-bit OS, dowload Adept Utilities x86 Linux. If it’s 64-bit kernel, download Adept Utilities x64 Linux. The downloaded software package is wrapped in format .tar.gz.

=== Digilent Plugins x86/x64 ===
Download Digilent Plugin for Xilinx Design Suite if you want to download your bitstream from XPS, ISE or iMPACT directly and debug with SDK or Chipscope. Digilent Plugin is alse available at [http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,66,768&Prod=DIGILENT-PLUGIN Digilent] website.

Chose the package according to your linux OS. If it’s a 32-bit OS, dowload Digilent Plug-in x86 Linux. If it’s 64-bit kernel, download Digilent Plug-in x64 Linux. The downloaded software package is wrapped in format .tar.gz.

== Installation ==
First of all, decompress all packages.

{{RootCmd|tar xzf digilent.adept.runtime_<version>.tar.gz
| tar xzf digilent.adept.utilities_<version>.tar.gz
| tar xzf libCseDigilent_<version>.tar.gz}}

==== Install Digilent Adept Runtime ====

Enter directory digilent.adept.runtime_<version>-<platform> then run the install script

{{RootCmd|./install.sh}}

{{note|If you are installing on kernel version grater then 3.0, you need to add the following lines after line 209}}

The lines should look like this:

{{Code|<nowiki>nano install.sh</nowiki>|<pre>
209 cprocUdev=$(ps -e | grep -i -c udevd)  
210  
211 if [ "${szVmjr}" = "3" ]  
212 then  
213        if (( $cprocUdev ))  
214        then  
215               let fUseUdev=1  
216        fi  
217 fi
</pre>}}

==== Install Digilent Adept Utilities ====

Enter directory digilent.adept.utilities_<version>-<platform>, and run command the install script. This time we will keep all default locations unchanged.

{{RootCmd|./install.sh}}

==== Install Digilent Plugin for Xilinx Design Suites ====

Enter directory libCseDigilent_2.0.5-<platform>
Enter directory of the Xilinx DS version installed on your computer. There is a pdf under the folder named: Digilent_Plug-in_Xilinx_<versionNo>.pdf. The document tells exactly how to install the Digilent Plugin and how to use it. To install plugin is quite easy, all you need to do is copy the libCseDigilent.so and libCseDigilent.xml Digilent plugins folder

===== 64 bits =====
{{RootCmd|cp libCseDigilent.so <Xilinx_DS_Path>/ISE/lib/lin64/plugins/Digilent/libCseDigilent/ && cp libCseDigilent.xml <Xilinx_DS_Path>/ISE/lib/lin64/plugins/Digilent/libCseDigilent/}}

===== 32 bits =====
{{RootCmd|cp libCseDigilent.so <Xilinx_DS_Path>/ISE/lib/lin/plugins/Digilent/libCseDigilent/ && cp libCseDigilent.xml <Xilinx_DS_Path>/ISE/lib/lin/plugins/Digilent/libCseDigilent/}}

If there is no dir ''Digilent'' under {{Highlight|<Xilinx_DS_Path>/ISE/lib/lin64/plugins/}}, just make a new dir with command mkdir.

{{RootCmd|>mkdir <Xilinx_DS_Path>/ISE/lib/lin64/plugins/Digilent}}

=== Testing ===

Connect your digilent board to your PC, and check whether Adept utilities can recognize your board. All you need is to run the command '''djtgcfg''' and see whether your boards pop up.

{{Cmd|djtgcfg enum}}

Now open Impact

{{Cmd|/Xilinx_DS_Path>/ISE/bin/lin/impact&}}

See if any FPGA can be found on your JTAG chain.

For now on I belive that you can walk by yourself, and begin to program your device.
