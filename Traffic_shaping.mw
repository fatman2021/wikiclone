This article aims to give a basic foundation to start traffic shaping to improve responsiveness (ping, RTT) on internet links. Especially asynchronous links like DSL benefit from this. PING round trip time can be improved as much as 10x during heavy download/upload with this traffic shaping in place.
 
== Installation ==
=== Prerequisites ===
You need to configure your Kernel with QoS support. You should add HTB, FQ_CODEL and Ingress queuing disciplines as well as IFB (Intermediate Functional Block device) and U32 match support.
=== Kernel ===
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
[*] Networking support  --->
    Networking options  --->
        [*] TCP/IP networking
        ...
        [*]   IP: advanced router
        ...
        [*]   IP: TCP syncookie support
        ...
        <*>   INET: socket monitoring interface
        <M>     UDP: socket monitoring interface
        ...
        <M>   The IPv6 protocol  --->
        ...
        [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)  --->
        [*] QoS and/or fair queueing  ---> 
            <M>   Hierarchical Token Bucket (HTB)
            <M>   Fair Queue Controlled Delay AQM (FQ_CODEL) 
            <M>   Ingress Qdisc 
            <M>   Universal 32bit comparisons w/ hashing (U32)

Device Drivers  --->
    [*] Networking device support  --->
        [*] Network core driver support
            <M>     Intermediate Functional Block support
</pre>}}

If you have IPv6 support on your network or plan to use IPv6 tunnels, you may set IPv6 Protocol to <M>. You should also enable Netfilter options, which enables the use of iptables firewall.

=== Iproute2 ===
Install {{Package|sys-apps/iproute2}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/iproute2
|ipv6+yes
|iptables+yes
}}

{{Emerge|iproute2}}

The iproute2 package installs the powerful tool called "tc". It is used to control and modify queuing and filters on network links.

Lets begin with a little example:
{{RootCmd|tc qdisc show dev eth0}}

By default, the pfifo_fast queuing discipline is used by the Linux kernel. It should not be listed by "tc qdisc show".

== Theory ==

There are two modes of traffic shaping, INGRESS and EGRESS. INGRESS handles incoming traffic and EGRESS outgoing traffic. Linux does not support shaping/queuing on INGRESS, but only policing. Therefore IFB exists, which we can attach to the INGRESS queue while we can add any normal queuing like FQ_CODEL as EGRESS queue on the IFB device.

The main reason for traffic shaping is that we cannot control the packet queues or prioritisation made by our ISP or in the external link. By limit our maximum bandwidth to 90% of our link speed we can make sure that any buffers (queues) that our ISP and our external link has will remain empty.

FQ_CODEL is a queuing discipline that is based on AQM (Active Queue Management). It aims to create fair bandwidth for all flows, while attempting to minimise buffers (and hence delays).

The INGRESS shaping below works like this:
# Create ingress filter on external interface
# Copy all incoming data to the IFB device
# Create an EGRESS qdisc on the IFB device and limit the bandwidth to 90%
# Attach the FQ_CODEL queuing discipline.

== Traffic Shaping Script ==
It is important that you set your upload and download speeds to about 90% of your maximum link speed. You also need to load all modules beforehand.

== Excplicit Congestion Notification (ECN) ==
You should enable ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) since FQ_CODEL uses this to notify the internet hosts about congestions (bandwidth over limit).
{{RootCmd|sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_ecn{{=}}1}}
