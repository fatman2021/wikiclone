wxFormBuilder is an application that can literally speed up GUI development, being ''Python'' either ''C++'' the programming language of your choice.

To install it, you need to first add the '''gentoo-zh''' overlay:
{{RootCmd|layman -a gentoo-zh}}

Then, since '''premake 3.7''' is currently an ebuild prerequisite, though the core system is already providing '''premake 4''', you have to directly specify it:
{{RootCmd|emerge ≈dev-util/premake-3.7}}

You may now proceed and install wxFormBuilder itself:
{{RootCmd|emerge dev-util/wxformbuilder}}
