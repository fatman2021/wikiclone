'''The world file, by default located in {{Path|/var/lib/portage/world}}, contains the set of package atoms that the user has explicitly asked to have installed.'''

It is the world file, together with the [[profile]] and {{Path|/etc/portage}} (including {{Path|make.conf}}) settings, that defines which software is installed on the system. Whenever a user triggers a software installation (through '''emerge <package-name>''') the software's package category and name are registered in the world file. Later, when a world update is requested (through '''emerge -uDN @world''' or similar), Portage will use this file as the base for its update calculations.

If you want to add a package to the world set without recompiling, use:
{{RootCmd|emerge --noreplace <package-name>}}

If you want to install a package without adding it to the world set, use:
{{RootCmd|emerge --oneshot <package-name>}}
