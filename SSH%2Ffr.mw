'''SSH''' ('''S'''ecure '''SH'''ell) est un programme de terminal chiffré qui remplace [[Wikipedia:telnet|telnet]] , l'outil classique des systèmes d'exploitation du type Unix.

En plus de l'accès par terminal distant procuré par le binaire principal '''ssh''', la suite de programmes SSH s'est développée pour inclure d'autres outils tels que '''scp''' (très largement utilisé) et '''sft''' (moins courant).

Originally, SSH was not free.  However, today the most popular and de-facto standard version of SSH is [http://www.openbsd.org/ OpenBSD]'s OpenSSH, which comes pre-installed on Gentoo.

== Running OpenSSH ==

=== Server ===
The OpenSSH server can be controlled like any other [[OpenRC]]-managed service, with '''/etc/init.d/ssh start''', '''/etc/init.d/ssh stop''', and '''/etc/init.d/ssh restart'''.

Note that active connections to the server remain unaffected when issuing '''/etc/init.d/ssh restart''', whereas running '''/etc/init.d/ssh stop''' followed by '''/etc/init.d/ssh start''' may cause disconnection.

== Configuration ==

=== Server configuration ===
The SSH server is usually configured in the {{Path|/etc/ssh/sshd_config}} file, though it is also possible to perform further configuration in OpenRC's {{Path|/etc/conf.d/sshd}}, including changing the location of the former.  For detailed information on how to configure the server see the ''sshd_config'' [[man page]].

You should also study this [https://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/docs/security_benchmarks/openssh.html guide] for a security focused configuration.

=== Client configuration ===
The '''ssh''' client and related programs ('''scp''', '''sftp''', etc.) are configured in the {{Path|/etc/ssh/ssh_config}} file.  For more information on how to configure these programs see the ''ssh_config'' man page.

=== Passwordless Authentication ===
very handy for [[git]] server management

==== Client ====
on your client run
{{Cmd|ssh-keygen -t rsa}}
then hit enter like 5 times to generate your key
move the client ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the server user your logging in as ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

==== Server ====
useradd a user

then place clients id_rsa.pub file into the new users ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

==== Single Machine Testing ====
{{Cmd|ssh-keygen -t rsa}}
enter 5 times

{{Cmd|mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys}}
{{Cmd|ssh localhost}}

== Troubleshooting ==
There are 3 different levels of debug modes.  ''-v'' Causes ssh to print debugging messages about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.  Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

debug1 mode:
{{Cmd|ssh example.org -v}}

debug2 mode:
{{Cmd|ssh example.org -vv}}

debug3 mode:
{{Cmd|ssh example.org -vvv}}

=== Death of Long-lived Connections ===
Many internet access devices perform network address translation ([[NAT]]), a process that enables devices on a private network such as that typically found in a home or business place to access foreign networks, such as the internet, despite only having a single IP address on that network.  Unfortunately, not all NAT devices are created equal, and some of them incorrectly close long-lived, occasional-use TCP connections such as those used by SSH.  This is generally observable as a sudden inability to interact with the remote server, though the '''ssh''' client program has not exited.

In order to resolve the issue, OpenSSH clients and servers can be configured to send a 'keep alive', or invisible message aimed at maintaining and confirming the live status of the link.
* To enable keep alive '''for all clients connecting to your local server''', set ''ClientAliveInterval 30'' (or some other value, in seconds) within the {{Path|/etc/ssh/sshd_config}} file.
* To enable keep alive '''for all servers connected to by your local client''', set ''ServerAliveInterval 30'' (or some other value, in seconds) within the {{Path|/etc/ssh/ssh_config}} file.
