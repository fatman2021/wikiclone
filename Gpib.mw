====== Linux Gpib Howto in Gentoo ======

linux-gpib with python flags is using python 2.7

===== Installing linux-gpib  =====

First set use flags in /etc/portage/package.use
  sudo vim /etc/portage/package.use

add line for python bindings and Documentation
  sci-libs/linux-gpib python doc
Other possible Flags ''pcmcia static debug guile perl php tcl firmware''
If you want to use ''pcmia'' you need to have a 2.7 kernel. But ''pcmia '' is normally just used in old computers so it doesn't matter.

Install it with 
  emerge -a sci-libs/linux-gpib
  
Add your user to gpib group
  gpasswd -a user gpib

===== Configuring linux-gpib =====

To configure Linux GPIB you need first to create a config file at ''/etc/gpib.conf''
  vim /etc/gpib.conf

Just an example which is for NI USB- HS Adapter is:

  interface {
        minor = 0
        board_type = "ni_usb_b"
        name = "joe"
        pad = 0
        master = yes
  }


You can lookup the board_type at [http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/doc_html/x259.html Linux-gpib-Website]


There is an example config file with more parameters on [http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/doc_html/r23.html GPIB-Linux Website]

After you wrote your own config file, you have to plug in your GPIB Device and either first chgrp the gpib Devices in /dev/ and make them write and readable
  chgrp gpib /dev/gpib*
  chmod g+wr /dev/gpib*

or do all things as root.

After doing that you should be able to call with root
  /usr/sbin/gpib_config -m 0
0 is the device you plugged in.

===== Example Python  =====

Be carefull linux-gpib cames with python2.7 bindings so first start python2.7
  python2.7

This example is tested with a HP8720D

To import gpib:
  import gpib
  
To get a device of a board named in ''/etc/gpib.conf'' joe:
  con=gpib.dev(0,16)  
0 is the GPIB BOARD and 16 the Adress of the Listener
  
To write a command:
  gpib.write(con,'STAR2400MHZ;')  

To read the result:
  gbip.read(con,1000) 
1000 is the Number of byte that are read
