====== Linux Gpib Howto in Gentoo ======

linux-gpib with python flags is using python 2.7

===== Installing linux-gpib  =====

First set use flags in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}}:

{{Cmd|sudo vim /etc/portage/package.use}}

Add line for python bindings and Documentation:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|1=
sci-libs/linux-gpib python doc
}}

Other possible Flags ''pcmcia static debug guile perl php tcl firmware''.
If you want to use ''pcmia'' you need to have a 2.7 kernel. But ''pcmia '' is normally just used in old computers so it doesn't matter.

Install it with:
{{Emerge|sci-libs/linux-gpib}}
  
Add your user to gpib group
{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a user gpib}}

===== Configuring linux-gpib =====

To configure Linux GPIB you need first to create a config file at {{Path|/etc/gpib.conf}}:
{{RootCmd|vim /etc/gpib.conf}}

Just an example which is for NI USB- HS Adapter is:


{{FileBox|filename=/etc/gpib.conf|1=
interface {
      minor = 0
      board_type = "ni_usb_b"
      name = "joe"
      pad = 0
      master = yes
}
}}


You can lookup the board_type at [http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/doc_html/x259.html Linux-gpib-Website].


There is an example config file with more parameters on [http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/doc_html/r23.html GPIB-Linux Website].

After you wrote your own config file, you have to plug in your GPIB Device and either first chgrp the gpib Devices in {{Path|/dev/}} and make them write and readable:

{{RootCmd
|chgrp gpib /dev/gpib*
|chmod g+wr /dev/gpib*
}}

or do all things as root.

After doing that you should be able to call with root
{{RootCmd|/usr/sbin/gpib_config -m 0}}
0 is the device you plugged in.

===== Example Python  =====

Be carefull linux-gpib cames with python2.7 bindings so first start python2.7

{{Cmd|python2.7}}

This example is tested with a HP8720D

To import gpib:

{{Cmd|prompt=>>>|import gpib}}
  
To get a device of a board named in {{Path|/etc/gpib.conf}} joe:

{{Cmd|prompt=>>>|con{{=}}gpib.dev(0,16)}}
0 is the GPIB BOARD and 16 the Adress of the Listener
  
To write a command:
{{Cmd|prompt=>>>|gpib.write(con,'STAR2400MHZ;')}}

To read the result:
{{Cmd|prompt=>>>|gbip.read(con,1000)}}
1000 is the Number of byte that are read
