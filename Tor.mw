== Emerge Messages ==

 * Messages for package net-misc/tor-0.2.3.25:

 * We created a configuration file for tor, /etc/tor/torrc, but you can
 * change it according to your needs.  Use the torrc.sample that is in
 * that directory as a guide.  Also, to have privoxy work with tor
 * just add the following line
 * 
 * forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .
 * 
 * to /etc/privoxy/config.  Notice the . at the end!

== Browser Configuration ==

=== Firefox ===

Edit > Preferences

Advanced > Network > Settings
<pre>
manual proxy configuration:
http proxy           port: 0
ssl proxy            port: 0
ftp proxy            port: 0
socks host 127.0.0.1 port: 9050
</pre>

=== xombrero ===

{{Note|Use libsoup 2.42.2 or newer and xombrero 1.6.0 or newer in order to use a socks proxy directly.}}

Edit .xombrero.conf and add there the following lines:

<pre>
# Browser mode, MUST be the first entry in this file
browser_mode			=	whitelist
# Proxy settings
http_proxy			=	socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
http_proxy_starts_enabled	=	1
# Homepage
home				=	https://check.torproject.org
# Force https
force_https			=	1
# No referer
referer				=	never
# Disable F2 so as not to toggle proxy settings by accident
keybinding			=	tabnew,F2
# Work directory (mount /tmp as tmpfs)
work_dir			=	/tmp/.xombrero
# Download directory
download_dir			=	/tmp/downloads
</pre>

Optionally, it is possible to set different user_agent and http_accept strings. There are two files with user_agent string and http_accept headers in xombrero source code folder: user-agent-headers and http-accept-headers. These strings can be easily selected and added to the .xombrero.conf file with the following commands:

{{Cmd|cat user-agent-headers {{!}} grep Linux {{!}} shuf -n 1 >> .xombrero.conf}}
{{Cmd|cat http-accept-headers {{!}} shuf -n 1 >> .xombrero.conf}}

{{Warning|Your browser fingerprint will be unique! Choose a more common user_agent/http_accept combination if this is a problem for you.}}

== Dns ==
Some applications may leak DNS requests. The easiest way to check if this really happens is to look at system logs.

{{Cmd|sudo tail -f /var/log/messages}}

If an application is configured correctly, nothing shows in the logs. Below is an example of a message for a misconfigured application (or for a webpage that stores links in form of IP addresses):

<pre>
Oct 14 14:44:44 localhost Tor[666]: Your application (using socks5 to port 80) is giving Tor only an IP address. 
Applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g. via privoxy or socat) instead. 
For more information, please see https://wiki.torproject.org/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS.
</pre>

In order to check how this works, one needs to give an application an IP address instead of a domain name, retrieved by running the tor-resolve command for example.

== Torify ==
{{warning|torify will fail if you do not have torsocks installed!}}
<pre>emerge -av net-proxy/torsocks</pre>
For applications which do not support the use of proxies or Tor, you can use the "torify" command to force their traffic through the Tor network. (e.g. - ''torify irssi -c irc.afraidirc.net'' '''or''' ''torify irssi -c mqctemuqfc3tp5ji.onion'').

== Tor Minimal Configuration ==
The following is a minimal configuration of Tor which will get your Tor service up and running.<br />
Just create your /etc/tor/torrc file with the following information.<br />
<pre>User tor
PIDFile /var/run/tor/tor.pid
Log notice syslog
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/data</pre>

== Setting up a Hidden Service ==
Setting up a tor hidden service is easy.<br />
All you need to do is add 2 lines to your /etc/tor/torrc configuration file, and make sure your permissions are correct for the data directory.<br />
<pre>HiddenServiceDir /tor/hiddenservice
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80</pre>

The first line tells Tor to insert the public&private keys into the directory specified.<br />
The next line tells Tor to direct traffic on hidden service port 80 to the IP & port specified.<br />
You will need to make sure that the directory is owned and only readable/writable by tor, for example:<br />
<pre>chown tor /tor/hiddenservice -R && chmod u+rw,g-rw,o-rw /tor/hiddenservice -R</pre>
