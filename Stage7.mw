'''Stage7''' is an attempt to increase the usability of Gentoo and other Gentoo-based, POSIX compatible Linux distributions by providing a way for users to automatically configure, build, and install new operating systems quickly and easily. The project exists to be an aid to ''existing'' Gentoo users by speeding up the "fresh install process" enabling them to move on to more important matters.

Stage7 is built off [https://github.com/agaffney/quickstart Andrew Gaffney's Quickstart] and is ''currently a work in progress''.
