''IPSet is used to set up, maintain and inspect so called IP sets in the Linux kernel. Depending on  the  type of  the  set,  an IP set may store IP(v4/v6) addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, IP and MAC address pairs, IP address and port number pairs, etc.'' - Wikipedia

IPSet is a tool for [[Iptables]] successor if IPpool is an administration tool for IP sets which can be added to iptables rules to filter out networks. 

== Installation ==
Install {{Package|net-firewall/ipset}}:
{{USEflag
|modules+yes
}}

{{Emerge|ipset}}

== Filtering ==
The simple following script can be used to filter IP adresses based on a file that have to be retrieved on the intertubes, and then create or update iptables firewall rules.

{{File|~/scripts/ips.sh||<pre>
#!/bin/sh
opt="hash:net --hashsize 64"
datadir=/var/lib/ipset
target=http://feeds.dshield.org/block.txt
wget -qNP $datadir $target || exit
set=IPBlock
tmp=${set}-tmp
ipset create $tmp $opt
networks="$(grep -E '^[0-9]' $datadir/$set | sed -rne 's/(^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}).*$/\1/p')"
for i in $networks; do
    ipset add $tmp ${i}/24
done
ipset create -exist $set $opt &&
ipset swap $tmp $set &&
ipset destroy $tmp &&
echo "IPSet: $set updated"
unset -v i networks opt set tmp</pre>}}

The previous script is just a simple way to retrieve different or various IPSet table and make use of an up to date filtering.

The script just create an new table and swap and destroy a previous set if there's one. For a more refined script see:
* [https://raw.github.com/tokiclover/dotfiles/master/scr/ips.bash ips.bash] - [[bash]] version
*[https://raw.github.com/tokiclover/dotfiles/master/scr/ips.zsh ips.zsh] - [[zsh]] version

And then save the rules to a file and start ipset init service.

{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/ipset save||/etc/init.d/ipset start||rc-update add ipset boot}}

The previous network filtering can be added to iptables with the following command.

{{RootCmd|iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set IPBlock src,dst -j Drop}}
