Chromium B.S.U. is a classic arcade raster graphics vertical scrolling shoot 'em up single player game. It was written with games like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows Raptor] in mind and the idea to enhance them for modern graphics. As such it uses opengl via {{Package|media-libs/freeglut}} or alternatively sdl, supports fullscreen and modern audio themes.

OpenClonk is the Open source successor of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonk Clonk gaming series], being a multiplayer-action-tactic-skill game. You could say it's an interesting mix of ''The Settlers'' and ''Worms''. In a simple 2D antfarm-style landscape, the player controls his crew of Clonks, small but robust humanoid beings. The game encourages free play but the normal goal is to build a mine and exploit the earth from valuable resources or fight each other on an arena-like map. Development is especially focused on Bustling mining, production lines and economy, fast and fiddly melees. Another focus lies on the further enchancement of the game engine and the extensibility/modability of the game content with C4Script.

There is also an addon manager integrated, you can find some addons [http://stkaddons.net here]. The gameplay combines regular kart racing with the possibility to collect items on the tracks with different properties (such as a cake bomb or a glue-like stuff to slow down opponents). You also have to look out for fuel items you can use to boost your speed for a short period of time. This makes the gameplay much more fun and reminds a bit of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Kart Super Mario Kart].
