This article lists and describes the setup of tools to detect hardware.

== Complete hardware list ==

=== lshw ===
'''lshw''' generates a structured list of detected hardware and their featues. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/lshw}}:
{{USEflag
|gtk
|sqlite
|static
}}
{{Emerge|lshw}}

=== hwinfo ===
'''hwinfo''' is the hardware detection of OpenSUSE and shows a lot details. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/hwinfo}}:
{{Emerge|hwinfo}}

=== kudzu ===
'''kudzu''' is the hardware detection of Red Hat. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/kudzu}}:
{{Emerge|kudzu}}

== Specific hardware ==

=== lspci ===
'''lspci''' lists all PCI devices. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/pciutils}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pciutils
|static-libs
|zlib+yes
}}
{{Emerge|pciutils}}

lspci detects the devices based on an ID database provided by {{Package|sys-apps/hwids}}. To get a more recent database install a new version of hwids.

=== lsusb ===
'''lsusb''' lists all USB devices. Just install {{Package|sys-apps/usbutils}}:
{{USEflag|package=sys-apps/pciutils
|python+yes
|zlib+yes
}}
{{Emerge|usbutils}}

lsusb detects the devices based on an ID database provided by {{Package|sys-apps/hwids}}. To get a more recent database install a new version of hwids.

=== lpinfo ===
'''lpinfo''' (part of [[CUPS]]) lists all printers and the used drivers.

* List all connected printers:
: {{RootCmd|lpinfo -v}}

* Lists all available drivers:
: {{RootCmd|lpinfo -m}}

=== scanModem ===
'''scanModem''' finds for a connected modem a suited driver. scanModem is not in the Portage tree, so you have to download it yourself and extract it:
{{Cmd|wget http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz
|gunzip scanModem.gz
|chmod +x scanModem
|./scanModem}}
It will create a folder {{Path|Modem}} and the file {{Path|scanout.something}} contains the wanted informations. If a modem is detected, the driver is named next to ''Drivers'', e.g. for a HSF modem:
{{File|./Modem/scanout.something||<pre>
Driver=hsfmodem-drivers
</pre>}}
