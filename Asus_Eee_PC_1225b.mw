== Graphics with open-source radeon drivers ==

All the necessary firmware is provided with x11-drivers/radeon-ucode package (it is easy to emerge within a chrooted environment): 

{{Emerge|radeon-ucode}}

Kernel parameters are well described in [[Radeon#Installation|the article about Radeon]]. However the choice of firmware isn't that obvious. As it is supposed [http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-907980-start-0.html here], APU is usually detected as PALM, while in fact it is closer to SUMO. The only way out is to compile them both into kernel: 

{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
        -*- Userspace firmware loading support
        [*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
            (radeon/PALM_me.bin radeon/PALM_pfp.bin radeon/SUMO_me.bin radeon/SUMO_pfp.bin radeon_SUMO_rlc.bin)
            (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
</pre>}}

This lets kernel modesetting work properly.

== Audio ==
=== ALSA configuration ===

{{Kernel||<pre>
Device Drivers  --->
    Sound card support  --->
        <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  --->
        	[*] PCI sound devices --->
			<*> Intel HD Audio --->
				[*] Build Realtek HD-audio codec support
                                [*] Build HDMI/DisplayPort HD-audio codec support
</pre>}}

A good way to manage ALSA is to emerge alsa-utils: 

{{Emerge|alsa-utils}}

To start alsa at boot time type: 

{{RootCmd|rc-update add alsasound boot}}

There is a problem that actually ALSA often sees two sound cards: HD-Audio Generic (that is a kind of a virtual device, i.e. it doesn't actually play music) and the required HDA ATI SB. The simplest way to check it is to launch

{{Cmd|aplay -l|output=
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: Generic [HD-Audio Generic], device 3: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: SB [HDA ATI SB], device 0: ALC269VB Analog [ALC269VB Analog]
  Suvdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0}}

If HD-Audio Generic is the first number, it might be the default card. If it is the case, than you're likely to have no sound unless the default card is switched from 0 to 1. 

{{File|/etc/asound.conf||<pre>
defaults.ctl.card 1
defaults.pcm.card 1
defaults.timer.card 1
</pre>}}
