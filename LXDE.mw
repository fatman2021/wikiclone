This guide introduces the user to LXDE, explains its components, and leads the user through the installation.

== Introduction ==

=== What is LXDE? ===

After installing your base Gentoo system, and [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration the X Server] , you have to make many choices regarding your graphical environment, if you want one at all. There are many options available to you, ranging from minimalistic window managers like [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/openbox.xml Openbox] , to full-featured desktop environments like [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/KDE KDE] , and [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/gnome-config.xml GNOME] . 

You may find yourself saying "well, I like the idea of having a lightweight graphical environment, but I don't want to install and configure every component individually like with Openbox." For quite some time, such users installed [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/xfce-config.xml Xfce] . While it provides a nice full-featured environment without the extensive resource usage of KDE or GNOME, it could still become a bit on the heavy side. Now, you have another choice: the [http://www.lxde.org Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment] , or [http://www.lxde.org LXDE] for short. 

=== Components of LXDE ===

LXDE, being a desktop environment, is comprised of several components. Each program offers a certain functionality, and together they form the complete desktop environment. Currently, there are eleven core components, and several other programs necessary to make a complete LXDE installation. These programs are the ones pulled in by the [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxde-meta LXDE meta] package, discussed in the installation section. 

=== Core Components ===

*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxappearance LXappearance] is a GTK theme and icon configurator that allows you to customise the look of LXDE
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxde-common LXDE-common] is a collection of default configuration files and the main set of icons
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxmenu-data LXmenu-data] is the application menu manager
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxinput LXinput] is a keyboard and mouse configurator
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxpanel LXpanel] is the panel that includes the application menu, system tray, and clock
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxrandr LXrandr] is a graphical interface to X Resize and Rotate, allowing for display manipulation
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxsession LXsession] is a session manager, providing options to shutdown, reboot, and suspend the system
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxsession-edit LXsession-edit] allows you to enable/disable applications at startup
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxshortcut LXshortcut] is an easy way to edit application shortcuts, especially for desktop icons
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxtask LXtask] is the task manager used to view/edit running services and programs
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/lxde-base/lxterminal LXterminal] is the vte-based tabbed terminal emulator

=== Other Applications used by LXDE ===

*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/x11-wm/openbox OpenBox] is the window manager, responsible for drawing the containers for programs
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/x11-misc/pcmanfm PCManFM] is the incredibly fast, tabbed file manager
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/x11-misc/obconf ObConf] is the configurator for OpenBox, allowing you to change window decorations and more
*  [http://packages.gentoo.org/package/media-gfx/gpicview GPicView] is the default image viewer

== Installation ==

=== Initial installation ===

After you have emerged and configured [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration xorg-server] , you are ready to install LXDE. While you may install each component individually, the more efficient and preferred method is to emerge the meta package set: 

{{RootCmd|emerge -av lxde-meta}}

If everything looks to your liking (meaning the current set of USE flags, etc.), then say "yes" when asked if you want to emerge the packages. Just like with other desktop environments, you will need to tell the X Server to load LXDE automatically, by adding it to your {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} . 

{{Cmd|echo "exec startlxde" >> ~/.xinitrc}}

This will automatically start your LXDE session when you type <code>startx</code> at the console. 

{{Note|If you use a login manager like SLiM, XDM, GDM, or KDM, you do not need to edit your {{Path|~/.xinitrc}} . LXDE will simply show up as a choice in your login manager's screen.}}

{{Important|As each user has his or her own {{Path|.xinitrc}} , you need to make sure to issue that command as ''your user'' , not as root.}}

== Configuration ==

=== GTK icon warning ===

Now that the X server knows to start LXDE on command, type in <code>startx</code> to fire up LXDE. The first thing you may notice is that you get a warning about an improper GTK icon set. To fix this minor hangup, you simply need to change the icon theme. To do so, click on the LXDE application menu (in the lower left-hand corner of the panel), and go to Preferences --> Appearance. In the LXappearance menu, click on the "Icon" tab, and choose nuoveXT.2.2. Hit "Apply," and then "Close." The next time you login to LXDE, the error message will not appear. However, you are not limited to using the nuoveXT.2.2 icon theme. You may install any other icon theme through LXappearance, and when it is selected, the GTK icon warning will no longer appear when starting PCManFM. 

=== Right-click menu ===

In LXDE, every appearance option is not handled through LXappearance as one might believe. Rather, there are some common options that are handled through a right-click menu on the desktop. At the bottom of that menu is the "Desktop Settings" menu. In here, you can find icon sizes, single-click and double-click behavior, maximum thumbnail size, and desktop wallpaper settings. It may behoove you to look through the these tabs for additional appearance settings. 

{{Note|These "Desktop Settings" can also be found by opening up the file manager (PCManFM), and going to Edit --> Preferences.}}

== Additional applications ==

* Text Editor : {{Package|app-editors/leafpad}}
* LXDE Display Manager : {{Package|lxde-base/lxdm}}

=== Taking screenshots with xwd ===

There are many ways to take screenshots in LXDE, but all require some work. 
Solution below uses xwd to capture screenshots, imagemagick's convert to save them to png, and 
notify-send to send a notification to desktop.

See {{Package|x11-apps/xwd}}, {{Package|media-gfx/imagemagick}}, {{Package|xfce-extra/xfce4-notifyd}}.

It places screenshots in $HOME/screenshots/.

First create key bindings:

{{File|~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml||<pre>
...
</keyboard>
  ...
  <!-- taking screenshots -->
  <keybind key="Print">
    <action name="Execute">
      <command>/usr/local/bin/screenshot.sh</command>
    </action>
  </keybind>
  <keybind key="A-Print">
    <action name="Execute">
      <command>/usr/local/bin/screenshot.sh window</command>
    </action>
  </keybind>
  ...
</keyboard>
...
</pre>}}

Then create and make executable the following simple script:

{{File|/usr/local/bin/screenshot.sh||<pre>
#!/bin/bash
  
FOLDER="$HOME/screenshots/"
  
if [ ! -d "${FOLDER}" ]; then
  mkdir ${FOLDER}
fi
  
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d@%H.%M.%S)
FNAME="${FOLDER}screenshot-${DATE}.png"
C=0
while [ -f "${FNAME}" ] ; do
    FNAME="${FOLDER}screenshot-${DATE}.${C}.png"
    let C++
done
  
touch ${FNAME}
  
if [ "$1" != "window" ]; then
  if xwd -root | convert - "${FNAME}"; then
    notify-send "Desktop screenshot saved!" "Desktop screenshot was saved as:\n ${FNAME}"
  else
    notify-send "Desktop screenshot could not be saved!" "There was an error."
  fi
else
  if xwd | convert - "${FNAME}"; then
    notify-send "Window screenshot saved!" "Window screenshot was saved as:\n ${FNAME}"
  else
    notify-send "Window screenshot could not be saved!" "There was an error."
  fi
fi
</pre>}}

Though this guide will help you get LXDE installed, the documentation does not stop here. There are many resources available to you regarding the various facets of the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. Some such resources are listed below: 

* On the [http://www.lxde.org Official LXDE website] you will find information regarding developmental progress, a community of support, and recommend system specifications for running LXDE
* The [http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Main_Page LXDE wiki] contains instructions for customising your LXDE installation, including keyboard layouts, autostarting applications, changing the default window manager, and much more
