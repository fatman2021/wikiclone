The '''sudo''' command provides a simple and secure way to configure privilege escalation, e.g. letting normal users to execute certain (or all) commands as root or some different user, possibly without giving a password.
== Installation ==
Install the package {{Package|app-admin/sudo}}
{{Emerge|app-admin/sudo}}

=== Configuration ===
The main sudo configuration file is located at /etc/sudoers but should never be edited directly. The directory /etc/sudoers.d/ can also contain various drop-in policy files. 

The '''visudo''' command provides a safe way to edit the configuration file(s). See the '''visudo(8)''' manual page for details.
The special syntax is described in the '''sudoers(5)''' manual page.  

{{RootCmd|visudo}}
==== Simple "overkill" policy ====
{{Warning|Such a loose policy may be a great security threat in many situations, even on personal computers. Without the '''NOPASSWD:''' option it may be a little safer.}}
To enable any user in the wheel group to run any command as any user (including root) without giving a password remove the # at the beginning of the line....
{{File|/etc/sudoers||<pre>
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
</pre>
}}
To add a user to the wheel group run

{{RootCmd|gpasswd -a $USER wheel}}

Then either log out and in again or restart for the groups to be updated.
==== Tight security policy ====
If you want to have a more secure sudo policy, make list of all commands that you need to run as root and define a strict sudo policy only for them.
An example for a simple one user personal computer:
{{File|/etc/sudoers||<pre>
larry gentbox = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend, /usr/sbin/pm-hibernate, /bin/mount, /bin/umount
</pre>}}
where larry is the user that should be able to run the commands as root and gentbox is the hostname of the computer.
=== Usage ===
Once you have the policies set up, you can prefix any command you wish to run with different permissions with ''sudo''.
The simplest case is to run a program as root (assuming you have the right policy set up):
{{Cmd|sudo shutdown -h now}}
Sudo offers many other sophisticated ways to run a command with different permissions (e.g. only with different group permissions) as documented in the '''sudo(8)'''  manual page.

=== Bash Completion ===

Users that want bash completion with sudo need to run this once.

{{Cmd|sudo echo "complete -cf sudo" >> $HOME/.bashrc}}
