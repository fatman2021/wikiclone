The ''BIOS'' ('''B'''asic '''I'''nput/'''O'''utput '''S'''ystem) is until now the firmware of each IBM-compatible PC and Laptop.

== Configuration ==
For configuration enter the  BIOS setup. To enter the setup you have to press a computer specific key, like:
* {{Key|Del}}
* {{Key|F1}}
* {{Key|F2}}
You find your key in your motherboard or computer manual. Also the right key is shown during boot time, right after after poweron. To enter setup press the key ca. two seconds after poweron, even if there is no screen displayed.

In the setup you can configure several features:
* enable or disable built-in hardware devices
* configure hardware features
* set date and time
* select a boot drive and order,
* specify a boot password

To operate the setup with an USB keyboard, you have to enable a function called '''USB Legacy''' or similar.

=== Set boot drive and order ===
You change in the BIOS setup the boot drive and order. Set the first drive where you installed the bootloader to speed up boot time. The BIOS take some time to check optical and floppy disk drives for a valid boot loader.

For [[USB]] boot drives you have to enable the function called '''USB Legacy''' or similar.

Newer BIOS versions knows a key you can press during boot to open a menu, where you select the boot drive. This is handy, if you want to boot from a LiveCD. Possible keys are:
* {{Key|F11}}
* {{Key|F12}}
You find your key in your motherboard or computer manual. Also the right key is shown during boot time, right after after poweron. To enter setup press the key ca. two seconds after poweron, even if there is no screen displayed.
