[[Qt Desktop applications]] need a little help to use your desktop theme in [[GNOME]].

== Setup ==
The GTK+ style for Qt can be built by setting the ''gtkstyle'' USE flag for {{Package|dev-qt/qtgui}}.

Set the ''gtkstyle'' USE flag. If there is a blocker, unset the '''qt4''' flag in {{Package|x11-libs/cairo}}:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use||<pre>
dev-qt/qtgui gtkstyle
x11-libs/cairo -qt4
</pre>}}
and rebuild the packages with their new USE flags:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use|qtgui cairo}}

== Configuration ==
You might need to reselect the preferred theme for Qt applications using ''qtconfig'' (from {{Package|dev-qt/qt3support}}):
{{Cmd|qtconfig}}
or just delete the previous configuration files:
{{Cmd|rm -r ~/.config/Trolltech*}}
Select the '''Default''' theme to use your system settings or set it to use the '''GTK+''' style explicitly by selecting '''GTK+''' theme.

=== Tips ===
* Individual applications might have their own configuration settings for their GUI, e.g. in VLC this is located in Tools → Preferences.

== Caveats ==
* 32bit applications on multilib systems are still unaware of the system's GTK+ theme, probably because {{Package|app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-qtlibs}} is compiled without the '''gtkstyle''' USE flag enabled.

== GTK+2 alternative ==
An alternative for users of GTK+2 and Qt4 is using the QtCurve cross-toolkit theme:
{{emerge|gtk-engines-qtcurve qtcurve-qt4}}
The downsides of this method are that it's not available for GTK+3 yet, and currently the only configuration GUI needs KDE4.
