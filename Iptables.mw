'''iptables'''<ref>[http://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/ The netfilter.org "iptables" project]</ref> is a program used to configure and manage the kernels netfilter modules.

== Installation ==
=== Prerequisites ===
First off, you will need to configure your kernel with netfilter support. If you want to be able to add rules based on IP filtering like black listing IP addresses based on a live feed [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-863121.html], do not forget to add [[IPSet]] support to your kernel and merge {{Package|net-firewall/ipset}} package.

=== Kernel ===

==== Kernel for Client ====
For client computers some basic options need to be activated in the kernel. This configuration does not provide network address translation or any other high sophisticated features. In "Network packet filtering framework" only the tables "filter" are needed with connection tracking support and with REJECT target support.

==== Kernel for Router ====
You need to activate the following kernel options:
{{Kernel||<pre>
[*] Networking support  --->
    Networking options  --->
        [*] TCP/IP networking
        [*]   IP: multicasting
        [*]   IP: advanced router
        ...
        [*]   IP: ARP daemon support
        [*]   IP: TCP syncookie support
        <M>   IP: AH transformation
        <M>   IP: ESP transformation
        <M>   IP: IPComp transformation
        <M>   IP: IPsec transport mode
        <M>   IP: IPsec tunnel mode
        <M>   IP: IPsec BEET mode
        <*>   Large Receive Offload (ipv4/tcp)
        <*>   INET: socket monitoring interface
        <M>     UDP: socket monitoring interface
        [ ]   TCP: advanced congestion control  --->
        ...
        <M>   The IPv6 protocol  --->
        ...
        [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)  --->
            [*]   Advanced netfilter configuration
            Core Netfilter Configuration  --->
                <M>   "addrtype" address type match support
                <M>   "comment" match support
                <M>   "hl" hoplimit/TTL match support
                <M>   "limit" match support
                <M>   "multiport" Multiple port match support
                <M>   "recent" match support
</pre>}}

One can setup IPv6 support category to ''<M>'' to be safe and enable almost all Netfilter sub category as the following. Or else, enable only what you need and leave the other modules unset. You certainly would want almost all ''IP virtual server support'' core components (scheduler are certainly optional), ''IP: Netfilter Configuration'' support, ''IPv6: Netfilter Configuration'' for IPv6 support, ''IP set support'' for IP filtering based on IP, MAC, ports and then pick up what you need in ''Core Netfilter Configuration'' with at least: Netfilter: NFQEUE, LOG; Connection tracking: flow, mark, events, netlink; Netfilter Xtables: NFQEUE, LOG, conn{bytes,mark,state}, state helper with Xtables match: conn{bytes,mark,state}... you get the idea.

=== Iptables ===
Install {{Package|net-firewall/iptables}}:
{{USEflag|package=net-firewall/iptables
|ipv6+yes
|netlink
|static-libs++no
}}

{{Emerge|iptables}}

== Firewall ==
=== First Run ===
For some services such as [[sshguard]] & [[fail2ban]] you need a running firewall.  We will save a blank firewall rule set and start the firewall.

==== ip v4 ====
{{RootCmd|rc-service iptables save}}
{{RootCmd|rc-service iptables start}}
to start upon reboot
{{RootCmd|rc-update add iptables default}}

==== ip v6 ====
{{RootCmd|rc-service ip6tables save}}
{{RootCmd|rc-service ip6tables start}}
to start upon reboot
{{RootCmd|rc-update add ip6tables default}}

=== General Rules ===
To create firewall rules, we are going to use <code>ipt=$(type -p iptables)</code> or <code>ipt=$(type -p ip6tables)</code>. For IPv6 support to write down a few rules that will be loaded using <code>"$ipt-restore" <"$rules"</code>. (rules file are usally saved to <code>/var/lib/"${ipt##*/}"/rules-save</code> so that whenever your machine is powered on, the rules set will be loaded automatically with <code>/etc/init.d/"${ipt##*/}"</code>.

Lets begin with a little example:
{{RootCmd|"$ipt" -P INPUT DROP}}

If you're looking into the perfect firewall, the previous command will set up the policy for INPUT chain and will satisfy the more paranoid. However, the previous will drop every packet that will be sent to the local host. And usually nobody wants that to be a default policy. 

That example shows how we will be generating firewall rules.

=== Stateless firewall ===
Traditional firewall uses stateless firewall rules like:
{{RootCmd|"$ipt" -A INPUT --dport 80 -j ACCEPT}}

That simply opens a local port, to accept HTTP requests (`--dport' switch means destination port, and HTTP servers listen on port 80).

=== Stateful firewall ===
In a stateful firewall approach, the previous example will be handled like:
{{RootCmd|<pre>
"$ipt" -P INPUT                                                                                       DROP
"$ipt" -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 --syn -m conntrack --ctstate --state NEW                 -j ACCEPT
"$ipt" -A INPUT                                 -m conntrack --ctstate --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
</pre>}}

First, we will drop everything like a hot potato, then accept only incoming traffic depending on the state of the state of the packets (stated NEW here), and then establish the connection. Even better, we could place the last line before the second to avoid going into complicated filtering chain for already related and established connections.

This is how a stateful firewall operates to avoid opening unneeded holes and accept in/outbound packets based on the state of the packets.

=== Generating firewall rules ===
==== Generating firewall rules for client ====
A script as simple as shown here should be sufficient for most client computers. Store it in a save place. You only need it for setting up or for changing the firewall rules. Absolutely no need to run it on boot or shutdown.
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

iptables -F
iptables -X
iptables -Z

iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 3 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 11 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 12 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 113 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset

ip6tables -F
ip6tables -X
ip6tables -Z

ip6tables -P INPUT DROP
ip6tables -P FORWARD DROP
ip6tables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

ip6tables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 3 -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 11 -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -A INPUT -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type 12 -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 113 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
</pre>
An example of a higher sophisticated rule set with logging is shown in the forum discussion.<ref>[http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7578926.html#7578926 A simple example with logging]</ref>

==== Generating firewall rules for server ====
This section will try to build up a script that will generate a set of rules with internal and external interfaces.
