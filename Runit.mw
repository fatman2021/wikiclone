'''runit''' is an init replacement with service monitoring. It can be used in conjunction with OpenRC as an alternative to sysvinit.

== Post-Install Configuration ==
=== As PID 1 ===

Runit can be used as the system init. To do this, simply add <tt>'''init=/sbin/runit-init'''</tt> to your bootloader's command line and reboot. You can leave sysvinit installed and go back to it at any time by reverting the change.

Out of the box, runit-init has a very minimal configuration which will only get you to a console login. Although it would be optimal to have all your daemons started up in a single consistent way, you're free to mix and match between runit and OpenRC as you like. Your initscripts can be found in the "default" runlevel, which can be started  automatically on boot with the existing "local" service:

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/rc-default.start|title=Start up the default runlevel after boot|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
rc default}}
{{RootCmd|chmod u+x /etc/local.d/rc-default.start}}
{{RootCmd|rc-update add local boot}}

If you prefer to do it manually:

{{RootCmd|rc default}}

==== Reboot and Shutdown ====

Runit isn't directly compatible with sysvinit's "telinit", "halt", "poweroff", "reboot" and "shutdown" commands, however many programs (e.g. desktop environments) expect to be able to call some of these. It's possible to emulate the interface they need [https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7610342.html#7610342 with a simple script].

If all else fails, use <tt>'''runit-init 0'''</tt> to shut down or <tt>'''runit-init 6'''</tt> to reboot.

=== As a system service ===

Runit can supervise processes without running as init, or even necessarily as root:

{{Cmd|mkdir /path/to/service-dir/}}
{{GenericCmd|(Create your service directories and run scripts here, using the same layout as /etc/runit/runsvdir/all/)}}
{{Cmd|chmod a+x /path/to/service-dir/*/run}}

OpenRC can start this for you using <tt>/etc/init.d/local</tt> (see <tt>/etc/local.d/README</tt> for more details):

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/runsvdir.start|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
# Remember to add --user if you don't want to run as root!
start-stop-daemon --start --background --make-pidfile \
    --pidfile /run/runsvdir.pid \
    --exec /usr/bin/runsvdir -- /path/to/service-dir/
}}
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/local.d/runsvdir.stop|lang=bash|1=
#!/bin/sh
start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile /run/runsvdir.pid
}}
