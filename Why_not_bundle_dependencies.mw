The intent of this page is to collect information on dependency bundling as a reference to refer upstreams to, instead of explaining the same thing over and over again by e-mail. You are welcome to contribute to this page.

== What is a bundled dependency? ==
Say you develop and distribute a piece of software ''P'': a game, a library, anything.
Now a bundled dependency is some other software (or software library) that
# is shipped with the source code of ''P'' and
# is compiled and used when compiling ''P''

== Temptations ==
There are reasons why bundling dependencies happens again and again: there are certain benefits to it! So why is it tempting to bundle dependencies?

=== Comforting non-Linux users ===
Especially in Windows, shipping dependencies ''can'' be a favor to your users to save them manually wiring things together. Without a package manager there is no real-solution to that on Windows anyway. So the temptation is: if you use bundled code on Windows, using it on GNU/Linux too feels consistent and is easy on your mind.

=== Easing up adoption despite odd dependencies ===
If your software ''P'' has some dependency ''D'' that is not yet packaged for major distributions, ''D'' makes it harder for ''P'' to get in as packaging ''P'' forces the new maintainer to package ''D'' him/herself or to wait for someone else to package it for him/her.
Bundling ''D'' hides the dependency on ''D'' in a way: if the packager is not paying close attention ''P'' may even get in despite and with the bundled dependency. (It's only a matter of time until someone noticed the bundling, though)

=== Dependencies with unstable APIs ===
If ''P'' uses a library ''D'' with a very unstable interface that changes between minor versions, the developers of ''P'' are unable to produce packages which will work with each new release of ''D''.
For example, sometimes a new release of ''D'' would require major refactoring of ''P'' before ''P'' compiles properly against ''D''.
Bundling ''D'' with a particular release of ''P'' lets the developers of ''P'' choose a version of ''D'' which is known to be compatible with ''P''.
Often, this problem is encountered if the developers of ''D'' do not account for the difficulties which developers of ''P'' will face.
In other cases, the package ''P'' may be using private interfaces from ''D'' which are not intended for use by other packages—and are thus not guaranteed to be "stable" between releases of ''D''.

=== Private forks ===
If ''P'' uses a library ''D'', the developers of ''P'' may wish to make some changes to ''D'', for example to add a new feature, modify the API, or change the default behavior. If the developers of ''D'' for whatever reason are opposed to these changes, the developers of ''P'' may want to fork ''D''. But publishing and properly maintaining a fork takes time and effort, so the developers of ''P'' could be tempted to take the easy road, bundle their patched version of ''D'' with ''P'', and maybe occasionally update it for upstream ''D'' changes.

== Problems ==
So why is bundling dependencies bad after all?

=== Security implications ===

Let's consider you're a developer of ''foo'' and your ''foo'' uses bundled ''libbar''. Now, a very important security flaw has been found in ''libbar'' (say, remote privilege escalation). The problem is large enough that devs of ''libbar'' release fixed version right away, and distributions package it quickly to decrease the possibility of break-in to users' systems to minimum.

If a particular distribution has efficient security upgrade system, the patched library can get there in less than 24 hours. But that would be of no use to ''foo'' users which will still use their bundled vulnerable library. They would have to wait till you discover the vulnerability, update ''libbar'' sources, release the new version and distributions package the new version. In the meantime, users probably even won't know they are running vulnerable application just because they won't know there's a vulnerable library statically linked into the executables.

=== Waste of hardware resources ===
Say a media player is bundling library libvorbis. If libvorbis is also installed system-wide this means that two copies of libvorbis
# occupy twice as much space on disk
# occupy (up to) twice as much RAM (of the page cache)

=== Waste of development time downstream ===
Due to the [[#Downstream consequences|consequences]] of bundled dependencies, many hours of downstream developer time are wasted that could have been put to more useful work.

=== Potential for Symbol Collisions ===
If a program ''P'' uses a system-installed library ''A'' and also uses another library ''B'' which bundles library ''A'', there is a potential for symbol collisions.
This means that ''P'' might use an interface, such as ''my_function()'' and that the ''my_function()'' symbol would be present in both ''A'' and the version of ''A'' bundled inside of library ''B''.
If the system-installed copy of ''A'' and the copy of ''A'' compiled into library ''B'' are from different releases of library ''A'', then the operation of the interface ''my_function()'' might behave differently in each copy of ''A''.
Since the program ''P'' was compiled against the system-installed copy of ''A'' and for various other reasons, if ''P'' ends up using the ''my_function()'' interface from the version of ''A'' bundled in library ''B'' instead of the interface in the system-installed copy.
This can potentially result in crashes or strange unpredictable behavior.
This sort of problem can be prevented if library ''B'' uses symbol visibility tricks when it links against library ''A'', which would cause library ''B'' not to export library ''A'''s interfaces.

== Downstream consequences ==
When a bundled dependency is discovered downstream this has a number of bad consequences.

=== Analysis ===
So there is a copy of libvorbis bundled with that media player. Which version is it? Has it been modified?

==== Separating forks from copies ====
Before the bundled dependency can be replaced by the system-widely installed one, we need to know if it has been modified: we have to know if it's a fork. If it is a fork it may or may not be replaced without breaking something. That's something to find out: more time wasted. If the code says which version it is we at least know what to run <tt>diff</tt> against; but that is not always the case.

==== Determining versions ====
If a bundled dependency doesn't tell its version we may have to find out ourselves. Mailing upstream could work, comparing against a number of tarball contents may work too.  Lots of opportunities to waste time.

=== Patching ===
Once it is clear that a bundled dependency can be ripped out, a patch is written, applied and tested (more waste of time). If upstream is willing to co-operate the patch may be dropped later. If not the patch will need porting to each now version downstream.

== What to do upstream ==
;(A) Remove bundled dependency
:  At best, remove the bundle dependency and allow compilation against dependency ''D'' from either a system-wide installation of it or a local one at any user-defined location. That gives flexibility to users on systems without ''D'' packaged and makes it easy to compile against the system copy downstream: cool!
;(B) Keep bundled dependency, make usage ''completely optional''
:  With a build time option to disable use of the bundled dependency it is possible to bypass it downstream without patching: nice! When keeping dependency ''D'' bundled make sure to follow the upstream of ''D'' closely and update your copy to a recent version of ''D'' on every minor (and major) release to at least reduce the damage done to people using your bundled version a little. Also: Clearly document if a bundled dependency is a fork or an unmodified copy and which version of the bundled software we are dealing with.
