Using qdbus (Qt/KDE):
{{FileBox|filename=~/.mplayer/config|1=
heartbeat-cmd="qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver SimulateUserActivity"
}}

For systems using xscreensaver alone:
{{FileBox|filename=~/.mplayer/config|1=
heartbeat-cmd="xscreensaver-command -deactivate >&- 2>&- &" 
}}

See [http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/faq.html#dvd this FAQ entry] for more informations.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== My video won't play! ===
MPlayer uses USE flags to enable and disable support for various codecs. If a particular type of file will not play in MPlayer, first check which USE flags MPlayer was emerged with. Update the USE flags to support for the format you are trying to play and recompile.
