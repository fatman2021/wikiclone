Since Linux kernel version 3.7 onwards, support has been added for signed kernel modules. When enabled, the Linux kernel will only load kernel modules that are digitally signed with the proper key. This allows further hardening of the system by disallowing unsigned kernel modules, or kernel modules signed with the wrong key, to be loaded. Malicious kernel modules are a common method for loading rootkits on a Linux system.

== Enabling module signature verification ==

Enabling support is a matter of toggling a few settings in the Linux kernel configuration. Unless you want to use your own keypair, this is all that has to be done to enable kernel module support.

=== Configuring module signature verification ===

Module signature verification is a kernel feature, so has to be enabled through the Linux kernel configuration. You can find the necessary options under ''Enable loadable module support''.

{{Kernel|Enable module signature verification|<pre>
--- Enable loadable module support
[*]   Module signature verification
[*]     Require modules to be validly signed
[*]     Automatically sign all modules
      Which hash algorithm should modules be signed with? (Sign modules with SHA-512) --->
</pre>}}

The option ''Module signature verification'' (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG) enables the module signature verification in the Linux kernel. It supports two approaches on signed module support: a rather permissive one and a strict one. By default, the permissive approach is used, which means that the Linux kernel module either has to have a valid signature, or no signature. With the strict approach, a valid signature must be present. In the above example, the strict approach is used by selecting ''Require modules to be validly signed'' (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE). Another way of enabling this strict approach is to set the kernel boot option <code>enforcemodulesig=1</code>.

When building the Linux kernel, the kernel modules will not be signed automatically unless you select ''Automatically sign all modules'' (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL).

Finally, we need to select the hash algorithm to use with the cryptographic signature. In the above example, we use SHA-512.

=== Building the kernel with proper keys ===

When the Linux kernel is building with module signature verification support enabled, then you can use your own keys or have the Linux kernel build infrastructure create a set for you. If you want the Linux kernel build infrastructure to create it for you, just continue as you always do with a <code>make</code> and <code>make modules_install</code>. At the end of the build process, you will notice that {{Path|signing_key.priv}} and {{Path|signing_key.x509}} will be available on the root of the Linux kernel sources.

If we want to use our own keys, you can use <code>openssl</code> to create a key pair (private key and public key). The following command, taken from {{Path|kernel/Makefile}}, creates such a key pair.

{{File|x509.genkey|Key generation configuration file|<pre>
[ req ]
default_bits = 4096
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
prompt = no
string_mask = utf8only
x509_extensions = myexts
  
[ req_distinguished_name ]
O = GenFic
CN = Kernel Signing Key
emailAddress = server.support@genfic.com
  
[ myexts ]
basicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE
keyUsage=digitalSignature
subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid
</pre>}}

{{Cmd|openssl req -new -nodes -utf8 -sha512 -days 36500 -batch -x509 -config x509.genkey -outform DER -out signing_key.x509 -keyout signing_key.priv}}

The resulting files need to be stored as {{Path|signing_key.x509}} and {{Path|signing_key.priv}} in the root of the Linux kernel source tree.

The public key part will be build inside the Linux kernel. If you configured the kernel to sign modules, this signing will take place during the <code>make modules_install</code> part.

=== Validating module signature support ===

Reboot with the newly configured kernel. In the output of <code>dmesg</code> you should be able to confirm that the proper certificate is loaded:

{{Cmd|dmesg {{!}} grep MODSIGN|output=<pre>
[    2.450021] MODSIGN: Loaded cert 'GenFic: Kernel Signing Key: b923a5f44eae25bbad52c8bf2742e7b7e6fb0c0e'
</pre>}}

The kernel modules have the digital signature appended at the end. A simple <code>hexdump</code> can confirm if a signature is present or not:

{{Cmd|hexdump -C vxlan.ko {{!}} tail|output=<pre>
00008880  cf 0e e7 cb 10 9e 98 5f  4b 21 d4 03 ba 3d 7e e7  |......._K!...=~.|

000088d0  9f 90 c4 eb b3 82 1d 9f  48 8c 5b 51 01 06 01 1e  |........H.[Q....|

000088f0  73 69 67 6e 61 74 75 72  65 20 61 70 70 65 6e 64  |signature append|
00008900  65 64 7e 0a                                       |ed~.|
00008904
</pre>}}

The string <code>~Module signature appended~</code> at the end confirms that ''a signature'' is present. Of course, it does not confirm that the signature is valid or not.

To remove the signature, we can use the <code>strip</code> command:

{{RootCmd|strip --strip-debug vxlan.ko
|hexdump -C vxlan.ko {{!}} tail|output=<pre>
00097330  6c 5f 67 65 74 5f 73 74  61 74 73 36 34 00 72 63  |l_get_stats64.rc|

000973ba
</pre>}}

If we try to load this module now, we get a failure:

{{RootCmd|modprobe vxlan|output=<pre>
modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'vxlan': Required key not available
</pre>}}

This confirms that modules without a signature are not loaded.

== Administering kernel module signatures ==

Once the kernel boots and we have validated that the signed kernel module support works, it is important to correctly handle the keys themselves.

=== Protecting the private key ===

The private key, stored as {{Path|signing_key.priv}}, needs to be moved to a secure location (unless you will be creating new keys for new kernels, in which case the file can be removed). Do not keep it at {{Path|/usr/src/linux}} on production systems as malware can then easily use this key to sign the malicious kernel modules (such as rootkits) and compromise the system further.

=== Manually signing modules ===

If you ever need to manually sign a kernel module, you can use the {{Path|scripts/sign-file}} script available in the Linux kernel source tree. It requires four arguments:

# The hash algorithm to use, such as <code>sha512</code>
# The private key location
# The certificate (which includes the public key) location
# The kernel module to sign

In this case, the key pair does not need to be named {{Path|signing_file.priv}} and such, nor do they need to be in the root of the Linux kernel source tree location.

{{Cmd|perl /usr/src/linux/scripts/sign-file sha512 /mnt/sdcard/kernel-signkey.priv /mnt/sdcard/kernel-signkey.x509 vxlan.ko}}

=== Distributing the kernel and modules ===

If we create a kernel package through <code>make tarbz2-pkg</code>, the modules in it will be signed already so we do not need to manually sign them afterwards. The signing keys themselves are not distributed with it.

== More resources ==

In [http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2013/09/02/booting-a-self-signed-linux-kernel/ Booting a self-signed Linux kernel] Greg Kroah-Hartman describes how to boot a self-signed Linux kernel from EFI. As having signed kernel module support is only secure if the Linux kernel is trusted, this is an important (and related) feature to work with.
