{{DISPLAYTITLE:ACCEPT_KEYWORDS}}
'''The ACCEPT_KEYWORDS variable informs the package manager which ebuilds' [[KEYWORDS]] values it is allowed to accept. The variable is usually set through the Gentoo profile but can be overruled in the users' <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code> file or even on the command line.'''

The default value of most profiles' ACCEPT_KEYWORDS variable is the architecture itself, like <code>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="amd64"</code> or <code>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="arm"</code>. In these cases, the package manager will only accept ebuilds whose KEYWORDS variable contains this architecture. If the user wants to be able to install and work with ebuilds that are not considered production-ready yet, he can add the same architecture but with the <code>~</code> prefix to it, like so:

{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="amd64 ~amd64"</pre>}}

It is generally considered a bad idea to override the ACCEPT_KEYWORDS variable on the command line, as this is not persistent and might result in unwanted behavior from the package manager.
