'''systemd''' is a modern sysvinit & RC replacement for Linux systems. It is supported in Gentoo as an alternate init system.

See also: [[Comparison of init systems]]

== Installation ==
{{Note|If you're updating, check the [[/upgrade|upgrade subpage]].}}

=== Prerequisites: kernel ===
systemd makes use of many modern Linux kernel features. Right now, the lower bound on kernel version is set in the ebuild to 2.6.39. In addition to that, the following kernel configuration options should be enabled:
<!-- See http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/plain/README -->

</pre>}}

=== Prerequisites: filesystem ===

==== /run directory ====
The {{Path|/run}} directory is used by systemd (and some applications) as a non-persistent storage for runtime data like pidfiles, sockets and state files.

The systemd package will create {{Path|/run}} directory itself. However, please note that this change will trigger automatic mounting of it in [[OpenRC]] as well, and may trigger using it by different software packages.

==== /etc/mtab symlink ====
Upstream suggests that the {{Path|/etc/mtab}} file should be a symlink to {{Path|/proc/self/mounts}}. This is not obligatory and can create problems with ''mount -o user'' and NFS mounts. On the other hand, not creating it will cause problems with "mount" ({{bug|434090}}) and "df" ({{bug|477240}}).

To create the symlink:
{{RootCmd|ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab}}

==== /etc/machine-id ====
Often systemd guides mention creating the file {{Path|/etc/machine-id}} as a global replacement for the D-Bus specific {{Path|/var/lib/dbus/machine-id}}. This is already done in the {{Package|sys-apps/dbus}} package.

=== Software ===
{{Note|It is necessary to install {{Package|sys-apps/systemd}} ''before'' enabling the flag. Otherwise, circular dependencies will prevent Portage from continuing.}}

Install {{Package|sys-apps/systemd}}

{{Emerge|systemd}}


Portage knows the global USE flag ''systemd'' for enabling use of systemd-specific libraries and features like socket activation or session tracking.
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
USE="... systemd ..."
</pre>}}
{{Warning|Some packages '''no longer support OpenRC''' after enabling the ''systemd'' flag}}

After setting this you want to update your system so the changes take effect:
{{Emerge|params+=--changed-use --deep|@world}}


{{Note|This is good place to restart udev service}}
{{RootCmd|/etc/init.d/udev restart}}


== Configuration ==

=== Configuration files ===
systemd supports a few system configuration files to set the most basic system details. 

A tool called ''hostnamectl'' exists for editing {{Path|/etc/hostname}} and {{Path|etc/machine-info}}. To change hostname:
{{RootCmd|hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>}}
Refer to ''man hostnamectl'' for more options.


{{File|/etc/hostname|A trivial file containing the system hostname. Replaces {{Path|/etc/conf.d/hostname}}.|<pre>frobnicator</pre>}}
This example sets hostname of ''frobnicator''.


{{File|/etc/vconsole.conf|Configuration file specifying console font and keymap. Replaces {{Path|/etc/conf.d/consolefont}} and {{Path|/etc/conf.d/keymaps}}|<pre>
KEYMAP=pl2
FONT=LatArCyrHeb-16
</pre>}}
{{Path|/etc/vconsole.conf}} doesn't yet support all features of those init.d scripts. This example is a simple console configuration.


{{File|/etc/locale.conf|Configuration file for locale settings.|<pre>
LANG="pl_PL.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="C"
</pre>}}
{{Path|/etc/locale.conf}} supports same syntax as shell locale variables, so you can basically rename {{Path|/etc/env.d/02locale}} or a similar file. This is an example for utf8.


{{File|/etc/machine-info|Configuration file for local machine informations.|<pre>
PRETTY_NAME="Larry's Computer"
ICON_NAME="computer-laptop"
</pre>}}


Systemd creates /dev/log as datagram socket [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=770810#c10] [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F16_bugs#systemd-syslog-ng-problems], so
{{File|/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf|Configuration file for syslog-ng.|<pre>
unix-stream('/dev/log');
</pre>}}
should be replaced with:
{{File|/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf|Configuration file for syslog-ng.|<pre>
unix-dgram('/dev/log');
</pre>}} in order to use syslog-ng service in systemd.


Systemd doesn't seem to respect {{Path|/etc/conf.d/dmcrypt}} ({{bug|429966}} ?):
{{File|/etc/crypttab|Configuration file for encrypted block devices.|<pre>
crypt-home UUID=c25dd0f3-ecdd-420e-99a8-0ff2eaf3f391 -
</pre>}}

{{Path|/etc/adjtime}} is a configuration file for system time. Replaces {{Path|/etc/conf.d/hwclock}}. See the [[system time]] article.

Additionally, the following configuration directories are both used by OpenRC and systemd:
* {{Path|/etc/modules-load.d}},
* {{Path|/etc/sysctl.d}},
* {{Path|/etc/binfmt.d}}

=== systemd-logind & pam_systemd ===
systemd intends to provide an integrated [[ConsoleKit]] replacement called logind. Some applications (like [[NetworkManager]] and [[polkit]]) provide support for it through ''USE=systemd''. Please note that this flag usually disables ConsoleKit support as well and thus packages may stop working as expected if the procedure described below is not fulfilled.
If you're having issues with {{Package|kde-misc/networkmanagement}} not being able to detect NetworkManager is running, modify your system-auth file to add pam_systemd.
{{File|/etc/pam.d/system-auth||<pre>
...
session         optional        pam_systemd.so
</pre>}}

In order to enable session tracking for systemd-logind, you have to enable the ''pam_systemd'' PAM module first. This can be done using USE=systemd on {{Package|sys-auth/pambase}}.

Except for tracking user logins (like ConsoleKit does), this will cause all user processes to belong to a cgroup. You can add ''controllers=...'' to provide additional cgroup controllers (like ''cpu'' for CPU load balancing). You can also add ''kill-session-processes=1'' to ensure that all processes spawned by user are killed on logout. For more information, take a look at ''pam_systemd'' [[man page]].

=== Enabling systemd ===
In order to run systemd, you have to switch the ''init'' executable kernel (or your initramfs) uses.

With simple kernels, the ''init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd'' argument should be added to the kernel command-line. An example excerpt from {{Path|grub.conf}} would look like:

{{File|/boot/grub/grub.conf|Example GRUB config for systemd with simple kernel|<pre>
title=Gentoo with systemd
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd
</pre>}}

When using [[initramfs]], other command-line argument will be needed. For example, genkernel uses ''real_init='' there:

{{File|/boot/grub/grub.conf|Example GRUB config for systemd with genkernel|<pre>
title=Gentoo with systemd
root (hd0,0)
kernel /my-genkernel... root=/dev/hda2 real_init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd
initrd /initramfs-genkernel...
</pre>}}

You can also set this in your kernel configuration. See "'''Processor type and features'''" -> "'''Built-in kernel command line'''". Note that this technique works for both grub and grub2.

At some point you will have to reboot your system in order to get systemd running (in system mode). Be sure to read all of this document to ensure you have systemd configured as completely as possible before rebooting. Note that journalctl(8) works with systemd(8) not running, but that systemctl(8) will not do anything useful without systemd running. You will likely want to complete the service configuration (enabling and starting of services) after you get logged in to your system running systemd.

=== Listing available services ===
All global service files are installed in {{Path|/usr/lib/systemd/system}}. Thus, the simplest way of looking up available service units is listing that directory:

{{RootCmd|ls /usr/lib/systemd/system|output=<pre>
acpid.service                            runlevel2.target
alsa-restore.service                     runlevel2.target.wants
alsa-store.service                       runlevel3.target
autovt@.service                          runlevel3.target.wants
avahi-daemon.service                     runlevel4.target
avahi-daemon.socket                      runlevel4.target.wants
avahi-dnsconfd.service                   runlevel5.target
basic.target                             runlevel5.target.wants
...
</pre>}}

The following file suffixes are of interest:
* {{Path|.service}} - plain service files (e.g. ones just running a daemon directly),
* {{Path|.socket}} - socket listeners (much like ''inetd''),
* {{Path|.path}} - filesystem triggers for services (running services when files change etc.).

Alternatively, ''systemctl'' tool can be used to list all services (including implicit ones):
{{RootCmd|systemctl --all --full}}

And finally the ''systemadm'' graphical tool can be used. It can be installed with the {{Package|sys-apps/systemd-ui}} package.

=== Installing custom service files ===
Any custom service files should be copied to the {{Path|/etc/systemd/system}} directory. The {{Path|/usr/lib/systemd/system}} directory is reserved for service files installed by ebuilds.

=== Enabling and disabling services ===
The usual way of enabling a service is using
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable foo.service}}

Services can be disabled likewise:
{{RootCmd|systemctl disable foo.service}}

These commands enable services using their default name in default target (both specified in ''Install'' section of the service file). However, sometimes services either don't provide that information or you want to use another name/target.

=== Enabling a service under a custom name ===
This is especially a case for template services -- services in which part of the name following ''@'' (at sign) is used as a parameter to the service. This is often used to specify the terminal on which getty will run.

To enable a service under custom name, you have to create a symlink to the service file in correct {{Path|/etc/systemd/system/*.wants}} directory. The name of that directory can either specify a target or another service which will depend on the new one.

For example, to enable stand-alone [[wpa_supplicant]] on ''wlan0'', type:

{{RootCmd|ln -s /lib/systemd/system/wpa_supplicant@.service /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service}}

To disable the service, just remove the symlink:
{{RootCmd|rm /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service}}

== Services ==

=== Native services ===
Some of Gentoo packages already install systemd unit files. For these services, it is enough to enable them. A quick summary of packages installing unit files can be seen on [http://qa-reports.gentoo.org/output/eclass-usage/systemd.txt systemd eclass users list].

=== OpenRC services ===
Although systemd originally intended to support running old init.d scripts, that support is not suited well for a dependency-based RC like OpenRC and thus is completely disabled on Gentoo. OpenRC provides additional measures to ensure that init.d scripts can't be run when OpenRC was not used to boot the system (otherwise the results would be unpredictable).
