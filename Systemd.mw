'''systemd''' is a modern sysvinit & RC replacement for Linux systems. It is supported in Gentoo as an alternate init system.
<!--
The following configuration directories are both used by OpenRC and systemd:
* {{Path|/etc/modules-load.d}},
* {{Path|/etc/sysctl.d}},
* {{Path|/etc/binfmt.d}}
-->
== Pre-installation Configuration ==
{{Note|If you're updating from <{{=}}sys-apps/systemd-203 check the [[/upgrade|upgrade subpage]].}}

=== Kernel ===

systemd makes use of many modern Linux kernel features. Right now, the lower bound on kernel version is set in the ebuild to 2.6.39.
In recent versions of {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}, there is a convenient way of selecting the mandatory and optional kernel options for systemd:
{{KernelBox|title=Quick setup using gentoo-sources|<pre>
Gentoo Linux --->
        Support for init systems, system and service managers --->
                [*] systemd
</pre>}}

If you wish to configure your Kernel options manually, or do not use {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}, the following kernel configuration options are required and recommended:
<!-- See http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/plain/README -->
{{KernelBox|title=Mandatory options|<pre>
General setup  --->
	[*] Control Group support
	[*] open by fhandle syscalls
	[ ] Enable deprecated sysfs features to support old userspace tools
	[*] Configure standard kernel features (expert users)  --->
		[*] Enable eventpoll support
		[*] Enable signalfd() system call
		[*] Enable timerfd() system call
[*] Networking support --->

	Generic Driver Options  --->
		[*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
File systems  --->
	[*] Inotify support for userspace

		[*] sysfs file system support
</pre>}}

{{KernelBox|title=Recommended options|<pre>

	[*] Namespaces support  --->
		[*] Network namespace
[*] Enable the block layer  --->
	[*] Block layer SG support v4

	<*> Kernel automounter version 4 support (also supports v3)
	Pseudo filesystems --->
		[*] Tmpfs virtual memory file system support (former shm fs)
		[*]   Tmpfs POSIX Access Control Lists
		[*]   Tmpfs extended attributes
</pre>}}

For UEFI system you'll also need to enable the following:
{{KernelBox|title=UEFI support|<pre>
[*] Enable the block layer  --->
	Partition Types  --->
		[*] Advanced partition selection
		[*]   EFI GUID Partition support
Processor type and features  --->
	[*] EFI runtime service support
Firmware Drivers  --->
        EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) Support -->
	        <*> EFI Variable Support via sysfs
</pre>}}

In the case you are using BFQ scheduler, it's recommended by BFQ upstream to enable "BFQ hierarchical scheduling support" under "Enable the block layer -> IO Schedulers"

For an up-to-date list, see section "REQUIREMENTS" in the upstream [http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/tree/README README] file.

===The {{Path|/run}} directory===

The {{Path|/run}} directory is used by systemd and other applications as a non-persistent storage for runtime data like pid files, sockets and state files.

The systemd package will create {{Path|/run}} directory itself. However, please note that this change will trigger automatic mounting of it in [[OpenRC]] as well, and may trigger using it by different software packages.

==={{Path|/etc/mtab}}===

Upstream only supports {{Path|/etc/mtab}} file being a symlink to {{Path|/proc/self/mounts}}. Also not creating this symlink will cause problems with ''mount'' ({{bug|434090}}) and ''df'' ({{bug|477240}}). In the past some utilities wrote information (like mount options) into {{Path|/etc/mtab}} and thus it was supposed to be file. Currently all software is supposed to avoid this problem but before you do switch check {{bug|477498}} to be sure that you are not affected by any regressions.

To create the symlink, run:
{{RootCmd|ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab}}

=== Ensure /usr is present at boot time ===
For a split /usr configuration, one must use an [[initramfs]] to mount /usr before starting systemd. See the [[Initramfs/HOWTO|Official Initramfs Gentoo Guide]] for instructions.

=== Using LVM2 and Initramfs ===
When [[LVM|sys-fs/lvm2]] is used and the system is booted using an initramfs, the initramfs will have to be created using {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel}} or {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}} by running:
{{RootCmd|genkernel --udev --lvm <target>}}
'''<target>''' is ''initramfs'' or one of the other genkernel targets which imply the creation of an initramfs. See: {{Cmd|genkernel --help}}

When LVM is used, the '''lvmetad''' daemon needs to be started as well. Otherwise systemd will be unable to mount LVM volumes. '''lvmetad''' can be enabled in {{Path|/etc/lvm/lvm.conf}}:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/lvm/lvm.conf|title=Snippet of required changes in lvm.conf|lang=ini|1=
# Set use_lvmetad to '1' for systemd
use_lvmetad {{=}} 1
}}

{{Note|Instead of modifying {{Path|/etc/lvm/lvm.conf}} this could probably be achieved through a ''lvmetad.socket'' unit which activates a ''lvmetad.service'', but current versions of {{Package|sys-fs/lvm2}} don't ship those yet.}}

== Installation ==

{{Package|sys-apps/systemd}} contains udev and, then, you can safely let {{Package|sys-fs/udev}} be removed as systemd will be the provider for {{Package|virtual/udev}}.

* Enable the systemd USE flag globally ({{Path|make.conf}}). The consolekit USE flag should also be disabled to prevent conflicts with the systemd-logind service. You can also switch to a systemd subprofile to use saner USE flags defaults not needing to change {{Path|make.conf}}:
{{RootCmd|eselect profile list}}

Then update your world with the new flags:
{{RootCmd|emerge -avDN @world}}

If you get dependency problems ({{Package|sys-fs/udev}} is blocking {{Package|sys-apps/systemd}}), sys-fs/udev may be in the world file.  Try to resolve this by:
{{RootCmd|emerge --deselect sys-fs/udev}}

== Booting with systemd ==

In order to run systemd, you have to switch the ''init'' that your executable kernel (or your initramfs) uses.

{{Warning|The services that you have set up in your previous service manager will not be automatically started, this is because you are switching to a different service manager; it order to obtain back functionality like for example the networking or a login manager, you will need to enable and start these services again. More information about this follows in the services section later in this article.}}

{{Note|In case your migration yields a broken state, you can always opt to boot back into the default service manager (OpenRC) by undoing this init change step; allowing you to use the troubleshooting section at the end of this article to fix the problem.}}

The following subsections document how to switch the ''init'' in one of the boot managers or the kernel.

=== Grub Legacy (0.x) ===

The ''init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd'' argument should be added to the kernel command-line. An example excerpt from {{Path|grub.conf}} would look like:

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.conf|title=Example GRUB config for systemd|1=
title=Gentoo with systemd
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd
}}
Should the system boot using openrc, try using ''real_init'' instead of ''init''

=== Grub 2 ===

If using the grub2-mkconfig configuration generator, add the init option to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX (it is ''not required'' if using initramfs generated by '''dracut with systemd''' inside).

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/default/grub|title=Example grub2-mkconfig config for systemd|lang=bash|1=
# Append parameters to the linux kernel command line
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd"
}}

If writing a configuration by hand (experts only), append the init parameter to the linux or linux16 command.

{{FileBox|filename=/boot/grub/grub.cfg|title=Example GRUB2 configuration fragment|1=
linux /vmlinuz-3.10.9 root=UUID=508868e4-54c6-4e6b-84b0-b3b28b1656b6 init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd
}}

If using genkernel-next's initrd, use ''real_init'' instead of ''init''.

=== In kernel config ===

You can also set this in your kernel configuration. See "'''Processor type and features'''" -> "'''Built-in kernel command line'''". Note that this technique works for both grub and grub2.

=== Setting root password ===
At this point you might also want to set your root password. If something goes wrong, systemd would prompt for root password to go into maintenance mode.

== Post Installation Configuration ==
systemd supports a few system configuration files to set the most basic system details.

{{Note|While some system configuration parameters can be updated by modifying the appropriate configuration files, most settings are managed using utilities that require systemd to be running. In this case, it is safe to reboot your computer with systemd and use the ''hostnamectl'', ''localectl'' and ''timedatectl'' utilities as required.}}

=== Hostname ===
To set the hostname, create/edit {{Path|/etc/hostname}} and simply provide the desired hostname.

When booted using systemd, a tool called ''hostnamectl'' exists for editing {{Path|/etc/hostname}} and {{Path|/etc/machine-info}}. To change hostname, run:
{{RootCmd|hostnamectl set-hostname <HOSTNAME>}}
Refer to ''man hostnamectl'' for more options.
<!--
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/machine-info|title=Configuration file for local machine information.|lang=bash|1=
PRETTY_NAME="Larry's Computer"
ICON_NAME="computer-laptop"
}}
-->

=== Locale ===
Usually, you will get your locale properly migrated from openRC when installing systemd. If required, you can set the locale in {{Path|/etc/locale.conf}} as per the Handbook instructions:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/locale.conf|title=System locale configuration|lang=bash|1=
LANG="en_US.utf8"
}}

Once booted with systemd, the tool ''localectl'' is used to set locale and console or X11 keymaps. To change the system locale, run the following command. 
{{RootCmd|localectl set-locale LANG<nowiki>=</nowiki><LOCALE>}}
To change the virtual console keymap:
{{RootCmd|localectl set-keymap <KEYMAP>}}
And finaly, to set the X11 layout:
{{RootCmd|localectl set-x11-keymap <LAYOUT>}}
If needed you can specify the model, variant and options too:
{{RootCmd|localectl set-x11-keymap <LAYOUT> <MODEL> <VARIANT> <OPTIONS>}}

=== Time & Date ===
Time and date can be set using the ''timedatectl'' utility. Managing the system time before booting with systemd is complex, so it is recommended to leave this until after booting and using the ''timedatectl'' utility. It is recommended for <tt>systemd-timedated.service</tt> to set a symlink from your timezone "{{Path|/usr/share/zoneinfo/[timezone]}}" to "{{Path|/etc/localtime}}". 
The ntpdate.service is deprecated and not useable anymore with networkmanger and systemd.

=== Automatic module loading ===
Automatic module loading is configured in a different file, or rather directory of files. The configuration files are stored in {{Path|/etc/modules-load.d}}. On boot every file with a list of modules will be loaded. The file format is a list of modules seperated by newline and can have any name you want as long as it ends with ''.conf''. You can separate out the module loading by program, service or whatever way you like. My <tt>virtualbox.conf</tt> example is listed below. But I can imagine one also has an <tt>iptables.conf</tt> for all the kernel modules needed for your firewall or one big file with all modules.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/modules-load.d/virtualbox.conf|title=Example file for the virtualbox modules|1=
vboxdrv
vboxnetflt
vboxnetadp
vboxpci
}}

=== Handling of log files ===
systemd has its own way of handling log files without needing to rely on any external log system (like syslog-ng or rsyslog). Messages can now be read with '''journalctl'''. Anyway, you can still configure it to use your preferred external tool for handling them. Please type '''man journald.conf''' for learning about how to configure journald to suit your needs.

=== /tmp is now in tmpfs ===
Unless you explicitly mount some other filesystem to /tmp in your fstab, systemd will mount /tmp as tmpfs. That means it will be emptied on every boot and its size will be limited to 50% of your RAM size. To know why this is the desired behavior and how to modify it, take a look at [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/APIFileSystems/ API File Systems]

=== Configure verbosity of boot process ===
When migrating to systemd you will probably notice differences regarding verbosity of boot process:
* ''quiet'' option not only affects to kernel output, but also to systemd itself. Then, while you are setting up systemd for your machine, you will probably want to drop it to see any errors could arise more easily. After that, you can add it back to get a quiet (and faster) boot.
* Even passing ''quiet'' option, you can still configure systemd to show its status by also passing ''systemd.show_status=1''.
* When not using ''quiet'' option, you could get some messages overwriting consoles, that is caused by kernel configuration (see ''man 5 proc'' and look for /proc/sys/kernel/printk). To tweak it you can pass the ''loglevel=5'' boot parameter to the kernel (or a lower value like 1).

== Services ==

At some point you will have to reboot your system in order to get systemd running (in system mode). Be sure to read all of this document to ensure you have systemd configured as completely as possible before rebooting. Note that journalctl(8) works with systemd(8) not running, but that systemctl(8) will not do anything useful without systemd running. You will likely want to complete the service configuration (enabling and starting of services) after you get logged in to your system running systemd.

=== OpenRC services ===
Although systemd originally intended to support running old init.d scripts, that support is not suited well for a dependency-based RC like OpenRC and thus is completely disabled on Gentoo. OpenRC provides additional measures to ensure that init.d scripts can't be run when OpenRC was not used to boot the system (otherwise the results would be unpredictable).

=== Listing available services ===
All available service units can be listed using the ''list-units'' verb provided by ''systemctl'':

{{RootCmd|systemctl list-units|output=<pre>
UNIT                               LOAD   ACTIVE SUB       DESCRIPTION
boot.automount                     loaded active waiting   EFI System Partition Automount

...
</pre>}}

The following file suffixes are of interest:
* {{Path|.service}} - plain service files (e.g. ones just running a daemon directly),
* {{Path|.socket}} - socket listeners (much like ''inetd''),
* {{Path|.path}} - filesystem triggers for services (running services when files change etc.).

Alternatively, ''systemctl'' tool can be used to list all services (including implicit ones):
{{RootCmd|systemctl --all --full}}

And finally the ''systemadm'' graphical tool can be used. It can be installed with the {{Package|sys-apps/systemd-ui}} package.

=== Installing custom unit files ===
Custom unit files can be placed in {{Path|/etc/systemd/system}}, where they'll be recognized after running:
{{RootCmd|systemctl daemon-reload}}
{{Path|/usr/lib/systemd/system}} is reserved for service files installed by the package manager.

=== Customizing unit files ===
When only minor changes to a unit are needed, there's no need to create a full copy of the original unit file in {{Path|/etc/systemd/system}}
Overriding settings in a package management provided unit can be achieved by drop-in files in a ''*.d'' directory named after the original unit (e.g. ''apache2.d'') in {{Path|/etc/systemd/system/}}.

{{FileBox|filename=/etc/systemd/system/apache2.d/mem-limit.conf|title=Example of adding/overriding settings in a service file|lang=ini|1=
[Service]
MemoryLimit{{=}}1G
}}

A reload of ''systemd'' is needed to inform it of the changes:
{{RootCmd|systemctl daemon-reload}}
Then the service needs to be restarted to apply the changes:
{{RootCmd|systemctl restart apache2}}
Verify, the changed property was applied to the service:
{{RootCmd|systemctl show --property{{=}}MemoryLimit apache2|output=<pre>MemoryLimit=1074000000</pre>}}

=== Enabling, disabling, starting and stopping services ===
The usual way of enabling a service is using
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable foo.service}}

Services can be disabled likewise:
{{RootCmd|systemctl disable foo.service}}

These commands enable services using their default name in default target (both specified in ''Install'' section of the service file). However, sometimes services either don't provide that information or you want to use another name/target.

Note that these commands only enable or disable the system to be started on a next boot; if you want to start the service right now, you can use
{{RootCmd|systemctl start foo.service}}

Services can be stopped likewise:
{{RootCmd|systemctl stop foo.service}}

=== Enabling a service under a custom name ===
When the name provided by ''Alias'' in the unit's ''[Install]]'' section does not meet the expectations and providing a permanent new value for this through a [[#Customizing unit files|customization]] is not desired, a symlink can be created manually in {{Path|/etc/systemd/system/*.wants/}}.
The name of the ''*.wants'' directory can either specify a target or another service which will depend on the new one.

For example, to install ''mysqld.service'' as ''db.service'' in the ''multi-user.target'':
{{RootCmd|ln -s /usr/lib/systemd/system/mysqld.service /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/db.service}}

To disable the service, just remove the symlink:
{{RootCmd|rm /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/db.service}}

=== Native services ===
Some of Gentoo packages already install systemd unit files. For these services, it is enough to enable them. A quick summary of packages installing unit files can be seen on [http://qa-reports.gentoo.org/output/eclass-usage/systemd.txt systemd eclass users list].

=== Timer services ===

Since version 197 systemd supports timers, making cron unnecessary on a systemd system. Since version 212 persistent services are supported, replacing even anacron. Persistent timers are run at the next opportunity if the system was powered down when the timer was scheduled.

The following is an example on how to make a simple timer that runs in the context of your user. It will even run if the user is not logged in. Every timed service needs a timer and a service file that is activated by the timer as follows:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.local/share/systemd/user/backup-work.timer|title=Example of a timer running every working day|lang=ini|1=
[Unit]
Description=daily backup work
RefuseManualStart=no
RefuseManualStop=no

[Timer]
Persistent=false
OnCalendar=Mon-Fri *-*-* 11:30:00
Unit=backup-work.service

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
}}

{{FileBox|filename=~/.local/share/systemd/user/backup-work.service|title=Example of a service triggering backup|lang=ini|1=
[Unit]
Description=daily backup work
RefuseManualStart=no
RefuseManualStop=yes

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/home/<user>/scripts/backup-work.sh
}}

Firstly, you must tell systemd to rescan the service files
{{Cmd|systemctl --user daemon-reload}}

You can trigger the backup manually by running
{{Cmd|systemctl --user start backup-work.service}}

You can start and stop the timer manually by running
{{Cmd|systemctl --user start backup-work.timer}}
{{Cmd|systemctl --user stop backup-work.timer}}

And finally to activate the timer at every system start run
{{Cmd|systemctl --user enable backup-work.timer}}

You can check the last result of running the service with
{{Cmd|systemctl --user list-timers}}

If a timed service runs and failes you can be informed by email. This is possible with the OnFailure stanza that allows you to specify what should happen if a service fails. A failure is detected by a non-zero return code of the backup-work script. For that change the script as follows:

{{FileBox|filename=~/.local/share/systemd/user/backup-work.service|title=Example of a service triggering backup|lang=ini|1=
[Unit]
Description=daily backup work
RefuseManualStart=no
RefuseManualStop=yes
OnFailure=failure-email@%i.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/home/<user>/scripts/backup-work.sh
}}

This requires you to have the service <code>failure-email@.service</code> installed, which can be found 
[https://github.com/kylemanna/systemd-utils/tree/master/onfailure here].

==== Replacing cron ====

The above timer and service files can also be added to {{Path|/usr/lib/systemd/system}} to make them available system-wide. The install section should then say <code>WantedBy=multi-user.target</code> to enable the service at system start.

However, cron also runs the scripts in {{Path|/etc/cron.daily}} etc. and several packages place scripts there that they expect to be run daily. You can emulate this behaviour with systemd by first installing {{Package|sys-process/cronbase}} and then [https://github.com/systemd-cron/systemd-cron systemd-cron]. Just run <code>./configure --enable-persistent</code> and <code>make</code>. You can ignore the systemd-crontab-generator stuff if you are only interested in running the files in {{Path|/etc/cron.daily}}. Just copy the files from {{Path|systemd-cron/out/build/units}} to {{Path|/usr/lib/systemd/system}}. Then ensure you adjust the path to <code>run-parts</code> in the service files. The <code>run-parts</code> script is located in gentoo in {{Path|/usr/bin/run-parts}}. Then activate your new cron replacement with

{{RootCmd|systemctl enable cron.target}}
{{RootCmd|systemctl start cron.target}}

* [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/Debugging Upstream debugging guide]

=== lvm ===
If you are switching from openrc to systemd and you need lvm to properly mount your volumes, you should activate lvm service:
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable lvm2-monitor.service}}
While it might not be needed for activation of root volume, if lvm is integrated into your initramfs, it might not work for other lvm volumes, unless
you activate the service.

=== systemd-logind & pam_systemd ===
systemd intends to provide an integrated [[ConsoleKit]] replacement called logind. Some applications (like [[NetworkManager]] and [[polkit]]) provide support for it through ''USE=systemd''. Please note that this flag usually disables ConsoleKit support as well and thus packages may stop working as expected if the procedure described below is not fulfilled.
If you're having issues with {{Package|kde-misc/networkmanagement}} not being able to detect NetworkManager is running, modify your system-auth file to add pam_systemd.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/pam.d/system-auth|1=
...
session         optional        pam_systemd.so
}}

In order to enable session tracking for systemd-logind, you have to enable the ''pam_systemd'' PAM module first. This can be done using USE=systemd on {{Package|sys-auth/pambase}}.

Except for tracking user logins (like ConsoleKit does), this will cause all user processes to belong to a cgroup. You can add ''controllers=...'' to provide additional cgroup controllers (like ''cpu'' for CPU load balancing). You can also add ''kill-session-processes=1'' to ensure that all processes spawned by user are killed on logout. For more information, take a look at ''pam_systemd'' [[man page]].
=== systemd-bootchart ===
{{KernelBox|systemd-bootchart support|<pre>
File systems  --->
	Pseudo filesystems --->
	[*] /proc file system support
Kernel hacking  --->
	[*] Kernel debugging
	[*] Collect scheduler debugging info
	[*] Collect scheduler statistics
</pre>}}
As systemd-bootchart attempts to start {{Path|/sbin/init}}, you may have to edit its configuration file:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/systemd/bootchart.conf|lang=bash|1=
...
Init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd
...
}}
Result is a report in svg located in {{Path|/run/log/}}.

=== syslog-ng conflicts with systemd ===
systemd creates {{Path|/dev/log}} as datagram socket [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=770810#c10] [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F16_bugs#systemd-syslog-ng-problems] so you will need to tell syslog-ng to read from a ''unix-dgram'' instead of a ''unix-stream'' if you are hitting problems and are using "wrong" stream:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf|1=
unix-stream('/dev/log');
}}
should be replaced with:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf|1=
unix-dgram('/dev/log');
}} in order to use the syslog-ng service in systemd.

=== sys-fs/cryptsetup configuration ===
systemd doesn't seem to respect {{Path|/etc/conf.d/dmcrypt}} ({{bug|429966}}) and, then, you will need to configure it in /etc/crypttab file:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/crypttab|title=Configuration file for encrypted block devices|1=
crypt-home UUID=c25dd0f3-ecdd-420e-99a8-0ff2eaf3f391 -
}}

=== Check for units that failed to start ===
To check for units that failed to start you can run:
{{RootCmd|systemctl --failed}}

=== Enable Debug Mode ===
To get more informations you need to set the following in {{Path|/etc/systemd/system.conf}}:
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/systemd/system.conf|lang=bash|1=
LogLevel=debug
}}
Or enable the debug-shell, that opens an terminal at tty9. This help to debug such service during boot process.
{{RootCmd|systemctl enable debug-shell.service}}

=== e4rat usage ===

Please remember to edit {{Path|/etc/e4rat.conf}} setting 'init' to /usr/lib/systemd/systemd, otherwise it will keep booting openrc.

=== Multi-PV VGs in LVM on LUKS configuration ===

If you have this configuration:
<pre>
sdX -> LUKS -> PV1 -> VG1 -> LV1(root) -> /
sdY -> LUKS -> PV2 \
                    |-> VG2 -> LV2 -> /home/SOME_FOLDER
sdZ -> LUKS -> PV3 /
</pre>
You may experience very slow boot-up and a couple of errors/timeouts from lvm2 systemd services (they are auto-generated by {{Package|sys-fs/lvm2}} when global/use_lvmetad=0 in {{Path|lvm.conf}}). They are caused by a timeout of ''lvm2-activation-early.service''.<br />
You may fix this by masking the service like this:
{{RootCmd|systemctl mask lvm2-activation-early.service}}
You may need to mask the ''lvm2-activation-net.service'' too:
{{RootCmd|systemctl mask lvm2-activation-net.service}}

{{Note|This fix is tested and valid for: {{Package|sys-apps/systemd-208-r3}} and {{Package|sys-fs/lvm2-2.02.105-r2}}. It may be fixed in future LVM or Systemd versions.}}
{{Warning|Do not mask the ''lvm2-activation-early.service'' if your configuration has LUKS on LVM (i.e. sdX -> LVM -> LUKS).}}

=== GRSecurity hardening ===

Synopsis: systemd-networkd log error<br />
<pre>could not find udev device: Permission denied</pre>
The error raises due to systemd-networkd works under non-root user.<br />
You should set kernel option CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_SYSFS_RESTRICT=N.<br />
