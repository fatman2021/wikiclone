MySQL is a popular, free software relational database management system. It is often used in conjunction with web applications (such as many PHP sites) but has gained many more enterprise-level features since its start in 1994.

== Installing MySQL ==

Like any other software, the installation of MySQL in Gentoo is pretty straight-forward:

{{Emerge|dev-db/mysql}}

To have the database(s) started automatically at boot, add it to the default runlevel:

{{RootCmd|rc-update add mysql default}}

When the database is configured, you can start the service:

{{RootCmd|rc-service mysql start}}

== Configuring MySQL ==

=== Preliminary configuration ===

The MySQL package maintainers (in Gentoo) will help you set up MySQL through the configuration option in the ebuild.

{{RootCmd|emerge --config dev-db/mysql}}

The configuration will create a database, set proper permissions on it and assist you in creating a good root password (this is for the MySQL root account, which is not related to the Linux root account).

=== In-database configuration ===

When the database is up and running, you can connect to it using the '''mysql''' client application.

{{Cmd|mysql -u root -p -h localhost|output=<pre>
Enter root password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 1 to server version: 5.5.1

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql></pre>}}

Once connected, you can launch queries as well as administrative commands.
