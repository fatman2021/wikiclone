=== Bin Installation ===
Since libreoffice is such a large package to compile it is also offered in pre-compiled bins.
{{emerge|libreoffice-bin}}
The binary packages are compiled such that they fit to the libraries of a stable Gentoo system. You will encounter difficulties if you try to use them on an ~arch system; this is not supported.
