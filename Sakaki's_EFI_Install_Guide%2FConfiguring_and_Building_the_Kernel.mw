<!-- Page: Configuring_and_Building_the_Kernel -->

<span id="config_and_build_kernel">In this section</span>, we'll be (loosely) following [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Kernel|Chapter 7]] of the Gentoo handbook, and building a Linux kernel for use with our new system. Accordingly, it's worth reading that handbook chapter in parallel with this guide. In addition, the Gentoo [[Kernel/Overview|kernel overview]] wiki page, and Greg Kroah-Hartman's ''Linux Kernel in a Nutshell'' are both highly recommended.<ref name="kernel_in_nutshell">Kroah-Hartman, Greg. [http://www.kroah.com/lkn/ ''Linux Kernel in a Nutshell'' (ebook)]. O'Reilly, 2006</ref>

The process we'll be following in this section is:
# Allowing necessary licenses, then downloading kernel sources and firmware (if desired);
# Emerging <tt>buildkernel</tt> (from <tt>sakaki-tools</tt>) and some additional required packages;
# Checking we have a custom version of <tt>gpg</tt> that will work without <tt>pinentry</tt>;
# Setting up <tt>buildkernel</tt>'s configuration file ({{Path|/etc/buildkernel.conf}}); and
# Building the kernel for the first time, using <tt>buildkernel</tt>.

However, don't worry, the process is perfectly manageable! No manual kernel configuration is necessary for the above, since the provided <tt>buildkernel</tt> tool will handle all the complexity for you (exactly what this script does [[#what_buildkernel_does|is also explained]] for the curious, but of course you can skip this material if you like).

== <span id="introduction">Introduction</span> ==

So what is the [[:Wikipedia:Linux_kernel|Linux kernel]] anyway? In essence, it's a privileged, pre-emptive, multitasking resource manager. As such, it's the core element of the operating system, because all 'normal' software (including operating system programs like <tt>cat</tt> and <tt>ls</tt>)  must go via the kernel to access system hardware (such as disks, screen and keyboard), to request or release system resources (such as memory), or to communicate with other [[:Wikipedia:User_space#Userland|'userland']] software (as the kernel maintains user processes in distinct virtual memory 'silos').

The kernel is ''not'' built using the normal <tt>emerge</tt> procedure - <tt>emerge</tt> ''will'' fetch the necessary source files for us, but configuration, compilation and installation is separate. {{Highlight|Configuration}} here refers to the process of setting (or in come cases, commenting out) key-value pairs in a special <tt>.config</tt> file. This file sets vital kernel parameters (such as the kernel command line, in the case of a UEFI-bootable system), and instructs the build system which kernel components (including drivers) to omit, which to build as [[:Wikipedia:Loadable_kernel_module|loadable modules]] ('.ko' files), and which to build in to the kernel itself.

Before continuing, it's worth saying a little bit about the EFI boot process here. When your PC boots up (in [[:Wikipedia:Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface|EFI]] mode), the UEFI BIOS loads from ROM and runs. Once it has performed initial hardware configuration, this BIOS then looks for any runnable EFI software, proceeding through a list of possible locations (which must be EFI system partitions, if they are storage devices) as specified by you via the BIOS setup screens (or the EFI boot list variable). If it finds such an executable (on 64-bit x86 machines, normally {{Path|/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi}}, the filename is not (usually!) path sensitive), it will load this and run it.

Traditionally, this program would be a [[:Wikipedia:Booting|bootloader]], whose job it would be to load and run the operating system proper. However, modern Linux kernels [[EFI_stub_kernel|can be configured]] to appear as runnable EFI programs, obviating the need for any separate bootloader, and this is the approach we're going to take.

However, there is one wrinkle to overcome. When our EFI kernel is started, it needs to invoke various userland software (such as <tt>gpg</tt>, <tt>cryptsetup</tt> and various LVM programs) to activate and access the encrypted volumes we created [[../Preparing_the_LUKS-LVM_Filesystem_and_Boot_USB_Key#setup_luks_lvm_process|earlier]]: but those programs are themselves stored... within the encrypted area!

This is <span id="initramfs_intro">worked around</span> by using an initial RAM filing system, or [[Initramfs|initramfs]], which is a simple archive (like a [[:Wikipedia:Tar_(file_format)|<tt>tar</tt>]] archive, but using an older format, known as [[:Wikipedia:Cpio|<tt>cpio</tt>]]) of a minimal Linux root filesystem. This initramfs contains only those userland programs (and the libraries and other files on which they depend) which are needed to boot the system (including a special ''init'' program, which we'll get to shortly). Although the use of an initramfs is reasonably commonplace with Linux systems (to start up LVM for example), we elect to include the archive within the kernel file itself, so it will be protected by the secure boot signature (once we add it).

So, the actual boot process we'll be aiming to utilize is as follows:
# The UEFI BIOS starts up, and initializes the hardware. It looks for, and finds, an executable .efi program (our stub-loadable kernel) on the USB key, so it loads this and passes off control to it. (If secure boot is on, it will also check that the kernel image contains a valid cryptographic signature, but we'll get to that in a [[../Configuring_Secure_Boot|later section]].)
# The kernel starts up and initializes. It unpacks its bundled initramfs into memory, and activates it, which provides a root directory containing a skeleton set of system files (a bit like the contents of our stage 3 archive, but much sparser).
# The kernel then looks for a special 'init' program in the initramfs and starts it (as the first userspace process).
# This initscript, which is actually provided by a Gentoo utility called <tt>genkernel</tt> (more of which shortly), prompts the user to enter a password, unlocks the .gpg keyfile (also on the USB key), and uses the resulting binary plaintext to unlock the LUKS partition. It next activates the LVM volume group on that partition (<tt>vg1</tt> in our case), and mounts any logical volumes (LVs) within it, as dictated by the file {{Path|/etc/fstab}}. This mounts the swap, root and home LVs.
# At this point the 'real' filing system is in place, and the initramfs (apart from {{Path|/proc}}, {{Path|/dev}} and {{Path|/sys}}) is discarded, using [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/switch_root.8.html <tt>switch_root</tt>]. The init script ends by invoking the 'proper' init system on this newly mounted root - which of course in our case will be the <tt>systemd</tt> daemon, which handles the boot from that point onwards.

Getting all of this to work correctly out of the box is complex, so I've provided a simple script (<tt>buildkernel</tt>) which automates the process, and which should enable you to create a bootable EFI kernel with minimal fuss, which we'll install from the <tt>sakaki-tools</tt> overlay shortly.

So, let's go build ourselves a kernel!

== <span id="downloading_kernel_source">Allowing Necessary Licenses and Downloading Kernel Sources and Firmware</span> ==
Our default allowed license group (<tt>@FREE</tt>), which we set [[../Installing_the_Gentoo_Stage_3_Files#set_license|earlier]], does not by default enable the 'freely distributable' requirement of the kernel sources (or that of {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}}), so we'll need to add that to our [[../Installing_the_Gentoo_Stage_3_Files#about_package_license|permitted license overrides]] (in {{Path|/etc/portage/package.license}}). 

{{RootCmd
|nano -w /etc/portage/package.license
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
}}
Then ''append'':
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.license|title=Append the following acceptable case-by-case licenses|1=
sys-kernel/gentoo-sources freedist
# Comment out the line below ONLY IF you are deblobbing your kernel.
sys-kernel/linux-firmware freedist
}}
Save and exit the <tt>nano</tt> editor.

{{Important|There's a <span id{{=}}"deblob_or_not">key choice</span> to make here. The package {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} contains (opaque) compiled software for lots of different bits of hardware you may have in your system. These images are ''not'' executed directly by the CPU, but copied up to the devices in question by their drivers when needed. Now, you might take the view that, since these images are not 'open-source' as such, they represent a taint and possible danger to your system. If that's your position, you should:
* ''not'' emerge the {{Package|sys-kernel/linux-firmware}} package when instructed to below
* comment out its corresponding line in the {{Path|/etc/portage/package.license}} file, above, and
* ''append'' the following line to {{Path|/etc/portage/package.use}}.
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=Append the following ONLY IF you want to exclude all firmware images|1=
sys-kernel/gentoo-sources               deblob
}}
'''Be aware:''' if you choose to go the full [[:Wikipedia:Linux-libre{{!}}Linux-libre]] route like this, your system will probably still boot, and chances are its wired interfaces will still work, but unless you are lucky your wireless devices will most likely not function (since many of these devices have only static RAM and require firmware uploads every time they are connected).<ref>Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux-libre#Effects_of_removing_proprietary_firmware "Linux-libre: Effects of removing proprietary firmware"]</ref><ref>Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_blob#Device_firmware "Binary blob: Device firmware"]</ref> In this tutorial, therefore, I have taken the pragmatic view of leaving the firmware in. If that makes you a little nervous, I'd suggest to try first building the system ''with'' firmware (i.e., per this tutorial's vanilla flow), get it to the point where it works successfully, and ''then'' try switching out the firmware (using the methods just mentioned). That way, you'll be able to roll back to the previous kernel if things go wrong. And if you are paranoid, you can always rebuild everything again from scratch, once you reach a stable configuration.}}
{{Note|Per the handbook, you don't ''have'' to use {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}}; there are a number of other alternatives within the Portage tree, which provide different spins on the kernel (e.g., for security hardened server applications).<ref>Gentoo Wiki: [http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kernel/Overview#Supported_kernel_packages "Kernel/Overview: Supported kernel packages"]</ref> However, we'll stick with {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} here as it's the most commonly used variant.}}

Right, let's fetch the kernel sources:
{{RootCmd
|emerge --ask --verbose sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
|output=<pre>
... additional output suppressed ...
Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No] <press y, then press Enter>
... additional output suppressed ...
</pre>
}}
<span id="install_firmware">And the firmware</span> (assuming you are following our default options, and not deblobbing):
{{RootCmd
|emerge --ask --verbose sys-kernel/linux-firmware
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
|output=<pre>
... additional output suppressed ...
Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No] <press y, then press Enter>
... additional output suppressed ...
</pre>
}}

Now we need to quickly double-check that the symbolic link in {{Path|/usr/src/linux}} is pointing to the correct place. Issue:
{{RootCmd
|readlink -v /usr/src/linux
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
}}
and check that the output of this refers to the same kernel version as following:
{{RootCmd
|eselect kernel list
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
}}
(the current default will have an asterisk marking it).
{{Note|At the moment, there should only be one version available in the output from <tt>eselect kernel list</tt>. However, as time goes on, and you update your Portage tree (discussed later), new versions of the kernel sources will become available. When you wish to work with one of these newer versions, you issue:
{{RootCmd
|eselect kernel set N
}}
to choose it (where N is a number in the list output by <tt>eselect kernel list</tt>, such as 1, 2 etc.) prior to building. This action modifies the {{Path|/usr/src/linux}} symbolic link.}}

== <span id="emerging_buildkernel">Emerging <tt>buildkernel</tt>, and Additional Required Packages</span> ==

We now have the necessary sources downloaded but, in order to proceed, there are two additional packages we should <tt>emerge</tt> first. These are:

* {{Package|sys-kernel/buildkernel}} This is the master build script, supplied from the <tt>sakaki-tools</tt> overlay (as described [[../Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#buildkernel_script|earlier]]). It pulls in a number of additional packages through its dependencies.
* {{Package|app-crypt/efitools}} This contains a number of tools for working with UEFI, including commands to manipulate UEFI secure variables, which we will need when setting up secure boot. Currently supplied from the <tt>sakaki-tools</tt> overlay, because of a required patch (see earlier [[../Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#efitools_patch|discussion]]).

Prior to emerging these, there are a number of [[../Installing_the_Gentoo_Stage_3_Files#about_package_use|package-specific use flags]] we'll need to set (some of these are in anticipation of <tt>buildkernel</tt> dependencies). Issue:

{{RootCmd
|nano -w /etc/portage/package.use
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
}}
and ''append'':
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/portage/package.use|title=Append the following per-package use flags|1=
# ensure we can generate a bootable kernel and initramfs
sys-kernel/genkernel-next               cryptsetup gpg plymouth

sys-boot/plymouth                       gdm
# required by plymouth (kernel mode setting library)
x11-libs/libdrm                         libkms
}}
Save and exit <tt>nano</tt>.

Here are what those flags do:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Package !! Use flag !! Description
|-
| rowspan=3|{{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}} || <tt>cryptsetup</tt> || This enables support for LUKS disk encryption in the initramfs, via {{Package|sys-fs/cryptsetup}}.
|-
| <tt>gpg</tt> || This enables support for <tt>gpg</tt> in the initramfs. We will provide our own version of <tt>gpg</tt> but we set the use flag here for forward compatibility.
|-

|-
| {{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}} || <tt>gdm</tt> || This allows for a smooth transition from the plymouth splash to Gnome.
|-
| {{Package|x11-libs/libdrm}} || libkms || This enables the building of <tt>libkms</tt>, a library for applications to interact with [[:Wikipedia:Mode_setting|kernel mode setting]]. It is required by (the default use flags of) {{Package|sys-boot/plymouth}}.
|}

Next, we can <tt>emerge</tt> the packages themselves. <span id="install_buildkernel">Issue:</span>
{{RootCmd

|output=<pre>
... additional output suppressed ...
Would you like to merge these packages? [Yes/No] <press y, then press Enter>

}}
and wait for the build to complete.

{{Note|This may take some time, so (just as we did [[../Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#use_showem{{!}}in the previous chapter]]), you can temporarily switch to the second <tt>screen</tt> virtual console and review progress with <tt>showem</tt>, if you like.}}

== <span id="ensure_static_gpg">Checking we have a Minimal, Static <tt>gpg</tt> (Without <tt>pinentry</tt>)</span> ==

The <span id="staticgpg_intro">installation of</span> <tt>buildkernel</tt> (which you have [[#install_buildkernel|just performed]]), should have caused a special, static version of <tt>gpg</tt> version 1.4.16 - called <tt>staticgpg</tt> - to have been installed on your system. The original (standard, v2.x) <tt>gpg</tt> should be present as well (since it's part of the [[System|@system]] set for this [[profile]]).

As both versions are important to the proper functioning of your system, we need to check they are present and correct. Issue:
{{RootCmd
|gpg --version && echo && staticgpg --version
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
}}
and verify that, per the messages produced, you do indeed have a v2.x and v1.x installed.

You can also verify that the <tt>staticgpg</tt> binary is statically linked:
{{RootCmd

== <span id="setup_buildkernel_conf">Setting Up <tt>buildkernel</tt>'s Configuration File</span> ==

Finally, before we can use the <tt>buildkernel</tt> utility, we have to set up its configuration file. An initial version has already been copied to {{Path|/etc/buildkernel.conf}} when you emerged <tt>buildkernel</tt>, [[#install_buildkernel|earlier]].  However, you must at least <span id="important_conf_vars">specify</span> the following shell variables:
*<tt>EFIPARTUUID</tt> - the UUID of the first (EFI system) partition on your USB boot key.
*<tt>CRYPTPARTUUID</tt> - the UUID of the LUKS partition which you created on your target machine's main drive.
*<tt>KEYMAP</tt> - the keymap to be used by the console early in the boot process. This is important for the passphrase protecting your LUKS keyfile to be recognized correctly. If you leave it commented out, the <tt>us</tt> keymap will be used.

You made a note of these UUIDs [[../Preparing_the_LUKS-LVM_Filesystem_and_Boot_USB_Key#finding_blkids|earlier]] in this tutorial (where we referred to them as the partition UUIDs of {{Path|/dev/sdY1}} and {{Path|/dev/sdZn}}, respectively). If the <tt>buildkernel</tt> <tt>ebuild</tt> was able to identify them unambiguously (i.e., for <tt>EFIPARTUUID</tt>, only one EFI system partition on a USB device could be found, and for <tt>CRYPTPARTUUID</tt>, only one LUKS partition could be found), then these will already have been set for you, when you emerged <tt>buildkernel</tt>, [[#install_buildkernel|above]]. In any event, you '''must''' check to make sure, because if these values are wrong, you may not be able to boot your new Gentoo installation successfully.

{{Note|By default, <tt>buildkernel</tt> assumes that your LUKS filesystem resides on a [[:Wikipedia:GUID_Partition_Table{{!}}GPT]] partition (which it will do, if you installed it in space freed up from Windows 8, per the earlier instructions in this tutorial). However, as of version 1.0.8 of <tt>buildkernel</tt>, it is also possible to specify the LUKS path directly, by setting the <tt>CRYPTPATHMAP</tt> variable in {{Path|/etc/buildkernel.conf}}. This may be useful for those whose LUKS filesystem is on an [[:Wikipedia:Master_boot_record{{!}}MBR]]-partitioned drive (if dual-booting with an older Windows 7, for example). Please refer to the <tt>buildkernel.conf</tt> manpage for more details.<br>Most users will not need to concern themselves with this option, however, and should entirely ignore the contents of this note.}}
There are two ways to do check (and, if necessary, fix) your setup: manually, or via <tt>buildkernel</tt>'s built-in menu-driven tool:

=== <span id="manual_buildkernel_conf">Option 1: Editing <tt>buildkernel.conf</tt> Manually</span> ===

You can always modify the configuration manually. To do so, issue:
{{RootCmd
|nano -w /etc/buildkernel.conf
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
}}
And then:
* uncomment (if <tt>buildkernel</tt>'s <tt>ebuild</tt> was able to identify only one such matching partition on a USB device, this will already have been set for you and uncommented, but you should check) the line setting <tt>EFIPARTUUID</tt>, and make sure that it refers to the partition UUID of {{Path|/dev/sdY1}};
* uncomment (again, <tt>buildkernel</tt>'s <tt>ebuild</tt> may already have set and uncommented this for you, but you must check) the line setting <tt>CRYPTPARTUUID</tt>, and make sure that it refers to the partition UUID of {{Path|/dev/sdZn}};
* if not using the US keymap, uncomment the line setting <tt>KEYMAP</tt>, and make sure it refers to the correct keymap (in the case of the CF-AX3, for example, we'd set <tt>KEYMAP="jp"</tt>).
{{Note|By {{Path|/dev/sdY1}} in the above we of course mean the USB boot key's first partition, and by {{Path|/dev/sdZn}} the LUKS partition we created.}}
{{Important|<span id{{=}}"deal_with_different_vg_name">In the unlikely event</span> you decided ''not'' to call your LVM volume group <tt>vg1</tt> [[../Preparing_the_LUKS-LVM_Filesystem_and_Boot_USB_Key#vg_name_warning{{!}}earlier in the tutorial]], you'll also need to set the variables <tt>CMDLINE_REAL_ROOT</tt> and <tt>CMDLINE_REAL_RESUME</tt> (which are ultimately used to set the kernel command line variables [[#real_root_var{{!}}<tt>real_root</tt>]] and [[#real_resume_var{{!}}<tt>real_resume</tt>]]). For example, if you called your volume group <tt>mynewvg</tt>, you need to set:
{{GenericCmd|<pre>
CMDLINE_REAL_ROOT="/dev/mapper/mynewvg-root"
CMDLINE_REAL_RESUME="/dev/mapper/mynewvg-swap"
</pre>
}}
in <tt>buildkernel.conf</tt> for the system to work correctly.
'''If you have used the recommended name (<tt>vg1</tt>), you do not need to worry about this point.'''
}}
{{Important|There is a <span id{{=}}"keymap_issue">bit of a subtlety</span> with the <tt>KEYMAP</tt> variable; this is processed by <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script, ''not'' <tt>systemd</tt> (which the <tt>init</tt> script eventually hands off to), so the string you need may be slightly different from that reported by <tt>localectl list-keymaps</tt> (which we'll use when setting up <tt>systemd</tt>'s configuration, later). Have a look in the file {{Path|/usr/share/genkernel/defaults/initrd.d/00-keymaps.sh}} to see the available keypap strings for use with this variable. For example, on the Panasonic CF-AX3 laptop, we need to use <tt>jp106</tt> for the <tt>systemd</tt> console keymap, but <tt>jp</tt> for the init script (and hence <tt>KEYMAP{{=}}"jp"</tt> here).

Alternatively, just use the <tt>buildkernel --easy-setup</tt> approach described below, and you can then simply choose your desired keymap from a menu!}}

=== <span id="assisted_buildkernel_conf">Option 2: Editing <tt>buildkernel.conf</tt> Using <tt>buildkernel --easy-setup</tt></span> ===

As it is important to get these settings correct, and easy to make a slip-up when manually editing a configuration file and copying UUIDs around, the <tt>buildkernel</tt> program provides a menu-driven helper to conform {{Path|/etc/buildkernel.conf}}.

To use it, simply issue <tt>buildkernel --easy-setup</tt>, and follow the prompts, making sure to save and exit when done. You can mix and match manual editing and using <tt>buildkernel --easy-setup</tt>; when you run <tt>buildkernel --easy-setup</tt>, any conflicting changes in your file will simply be automatically commented out, and any new definitions will be written to a delineated block at the end of the file.

Note how the changes made by <tt>buildkernel --easy-setup</tt> have been added in a block at the end of the file.

{{Note|<tt>buildkernel --easy-setup</tt> does not cover all possible changes you might wish to make to the configuration file, only the main variables. Therefore if, for example, you wished for example to enable TRIM support (see [[#enable_trim{{!}}below]]) for your hard drive, you'd need to set <tt>ADDITIONALKERNELCMDS</tt> variable in the configuration file directly - there's (currently) no menu-driven way to set that flag via <tt>buildkernel --easy-setup</tt>.}}

{{Important|We specify a '''textual''' boot at this stage (<tt>PLYMOUTHTHEME</tt> commented out in {{Path|/etc/buildkernel.conf}}), as we will try a boot without a graphical splash screen initially, for safety.}}

== <span id="what_buildkernel_does">What the <tt>buildkernel</tt> Script Does (Background Reading)</span> ==

Right, so now we're ready to build the kernel, using the <tt>buildkernel</tt> script to do all the heavy lifting for us.

{{Note|If you're interested in what this script does, read on, otherwise you can [[#build_using_buildkernel{{!}}skip over to the next section]] and get building right away!}}

The <tt>buildkernel</tt> script carries out the following steps in order:
# Reads your <tt>genkernel.conf</tt> file;
# Mounts the EFI partition if not already mounted (to {{Path|/boot/efi}});
# Enters the {{Path|/usr/src/linux}} directory;
# Copies a <tt>.config</tt> file from the currently running kernel (via {{Path|/proc/config.gz}}) if no config already exists in {{Path|/usr/src/linux}}, and sanitizes/updates it with <tt>make olddefconfig</tt>;
# Conforms the <tt>.config</tt>, by setting various key parameters that are required for the kernel to boot successfully in EFI mode with <tt>systemd</tt> (we review these [[#kernel_opts_set_by_buildkernel|below]]), including the rather gnarly [[#kernel_cmd_line_set_by_buildkernel|kernel command line]] (which contains directives targeted both at the kernel, and at the <tt>init</tt> script provided by <tt>genkernel</tt>);
# Calls your user hook function <tt>user_conform_config_file</tt> if you have defined it in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} (you'll only generally want to do this to override unwanted changes made by <tt>buildkernel</tt> in the above step; other changes should be made via the standard <tt>make menuconfig</tt> route, per the step below; they will be persisted);
# If in {{Highlight|interactive}} mode (set by the <tt>--ask</tt> option), allows you to <span id="make_menuconfig_step">modify the resulting configuration</span>, if you choose, using the standard [[:Wikipedia:Menuconfig|menuconfig]] tool (see [[Kernel/Configuration#Usage|this wiki entry]] for a brief set of usage instructions); (it's fine to elect not to, however, in which case the conformed <tt>.config</tt> will be silently sanitized/upgraded with <tt>make olddefconfig</tt>, as it will in non-interactive mode);
# Cleans the kernel tree (optionally, you can force this with the <tt>--clean</tt>, and you will be asked in interactive mode);
# Builds the kernel, and its modules, with the specified configuration; in this first pass, an empty initramfs is used (since it must be incorporated in the kernel, to be protected by UEFI secure boot, but we don't have everything necessary to include in it, yet!);
# If required (via the <tt>--build-external-modules</tt> option) builds any external modules (such as those required for VirtualBox), using [[:Kernel/Upgrade#Reinstall_external_kernel_modules|<tt>emerge @module-rebuild</tt>]];
# Creates a first cut of the [[initramfs]] using [[genkernel|<tt>genkernel</tt>]] (see [[#genkernel_opts_used_by_buildkernel|below]] for more details); this will contain <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script, compiled modules, any necessary firmware (if you haven't [[#deblob_or_not|deblobbed]]), and a minimal set of binaries; it does ''not'' at this point contain a static copy of <tt>gpg</tt>;
# Unpacks the initramfs, to the {{Path|/boot/initramfs}} directory;
# <span id="copy_static_gpg">Modifies the initramfs</span> by copying <tt>modprobe.d</tt> directory contents across to it, and copies the <tt>staticgpg</tt> binary we discussed [[#staticgpg_intro|earlier]], renaming it as <tt>gpg</tt> (if <tt>staticgpg</tt> does not exist, <tt>buildkernel</tt> will <tt>emerge</tt> it);
# Calls your user hook function <tt>user_modify_initramfs</tt> if you have defined it in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} (you don't need it to make the boot work);
# Repacks the initramfs into {{Path|/boot/initramfs.cpio}} (the unpacked copy is left at {{Path|/boot/initramfs}} too, for reference, since it's useful to be able to see what is in this archive at a glance);
# <span id="initramfs_into_kernel">Builds the kernel</span> a second time (to incorporate this 'real' initramfs); this is a quick process as most of the components are unchanged;
# If you have a secure boot key and certificate (we haven't, yet), signs the kernel so it will secure boot;
# Backs up the old kernel and config on the EFI system partition (on the USB key), if any are present;
# Copies the newly built kernel (which is configured so as to be an EFI executable), into {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi}} (the magic location expected by most UEFI BIOSes - you can change this path via {{Path|/etc/buildkernel.conf}}); and also copies the config to the same directory;
# If possible, ensures that there is an EFI boot entry for the new kernel, and that this entry is at the top of the EFI boot list (we aren't booted under EFI yet, so you will get a warning here instead);
# Performs a filesystem [[:Wikipedia:Sync_(Unix)|<tt>sync</tt>]] and then unmounts the EFI system partition (if you so specify).

The default behaviour of buildkernel is to run in an non-interactive mode, unless the <tt>--ask</tt> option is passed. It is also possible to specify the <tt>--stage-only</tt> option, in which case <tt>buildkernel</tt> will create a new kernel in the {{Path|/boot}} staging area, but will ''not'' attempt to copy it to the USB key. This is useful in unattended contexts, when you may have the boot key removed, for security. You can then subsequently copy over the new kernel with the <tt>--copy-from-staging</tt> option.

Furthermore, because this is a UEFI system (and we intend to use secure boot later), the initramfs' cpio archive must be embedded in the kernel itself, ''not'' provided as a separate file on the boot partition, and it must be uncompressed (this isn't really an issue, since the enclosing kernel image is ''itself'' compressed).

=== <span id="kernel_cmd_line_set_by_buildkernel">Kernel Built-In Command Line Conformed by <tt>buildkernel</tt></span> ===

At this initial stage, the built-in kernel command line (<tt>CMDLINE</tt>) will be conformed as follows (your specific values will be different, depending on what is set in <tt>EFIPARTUUID</tt>,  <tt>CRYPTPARTUUID</tt> and <tt>KEYMAP</tt>):

{{GenericCmd|root{{=}}/dev/ram0 crypt_root{{=}}/dev/disk/by-partuuid/8111286a-d24e-4ba2-b6af-d0650fab4130 dolvm real_root{{=}}/dev/mapper/vg1-root rootfstype{{=}}ext4 real_init{{=}}/usr/lib/systemd/systemd root_keydev{{=}}/dev/disk/by-partuuid/2498f874-ad8f-484e-8aba-81ac1c9665b6 root_key{{=}}luks-key.gpg real_resume{{=}}/dev/mapper/vg1-swap keymap{{=}}jp}}

Note that the term 'kernel command line' can be a little misleading - some of these parameters are indeed consumed by the kernel (a reasonably complete list of which is provided by kernel.org<ref>kernel.org [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt "Kernel Parameters"]</ref>); however, others are really targeted at the <tt>init</tt> script. The Linux kernel passes the <tt>init</tt> script (or program) any parameters it has not already processed as arguments,<ref>[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/boot.7.html <tt>boot</tt> (7) manpage ("Kernel startup")]</ref> and the <tt>init</tt> script can also read the full command line in any event, via {{Path|/proc/cmdline}}. 

The various parameters in the above are explained in the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Parameter !! Value in Example !! Value in <tt>buildkernel</tt> !! Consumed By !! Description
|-
| <tt>root</tt> || {{Path|/dev/ram0}} || <tt>${CMDLINE_ROOT}</tt> || kernel, <tt>init</tt> || This specifies the location of the root filesystem to the kernel. It is set to point to the device path for the initramfs, since that's what the root will be, until the LUKS partition is unlocked, the LVM volumes activated, and [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/switch_root.8.html <tt>switch_root</tt>] is called.
|-
| <tt>crypt_root</tt> || {{Path|/dev/disk/by-partuuid/8111286a-d24e-4ba2-b6af-d0650fab4130}} || <tt>${CRYPTPATHMAP}</tt> (which, unless explicitly overridden, will be <tt>/dev/disk/by-partuuid/${CRYPTPARTUUID}</tt>) || <tt>init</tt> || This tells the <tt>init</tt> script (provided by <tt>genkernel</tt>) which partition it should be attempting to unlock with <tt>cryptsetup</tt>. It is set to the partition UUID of the LUKS partition we created [[../Preparing_the_LUKS-LVM_Filesystem_and_Boot_USB_Key#format_luks_partition|earlier]].
|-
| <tt>dolvm</tt> || ''N/A'' || ''N/A'' || <tt>init</tt> || This instructs the <tt>init</tt> script (provided by <tt>genkernel</tt>) to attempt to initialize LVM volume groups at an appropriate point in the boot.
|-
| <span id="real_root_var"><tt>real_root</tt></span> || {{Path|/dev/mapper/vg1-root}} || <tt>${CMDLINE_REAL_ROOT}</tt> || <tt>init</tt> || This specifies the device path of the device holding the actual root directory (in our case, an LVM logical volume). The <tt>init</tt> script will switch to this once it is available, invoking <tt>systemd</tt> as it does so. Here, it is set to the device path of the <tt>root</tt> logical volume, from the <tt>vg1</tt> volume group.
|-
| <tt>rootfstype</tt> || <tt>ext4</tt> || <tt>${CMDLINE_ROOTFSTYPE}</tt> || kernel, <tt>init</tt> || Specifies the filing system used for the (real) root partition; by default [[ext4]] is used.
|-
| <tt>real_init</tt> || {{Path|/usr/lib/systemd/systemd}} || <tt>${CMDLINE_REAL_INIT}</tt> || <tt>init</tt> || The path of the 'real' init program to invoke, within the real root, once this is mounted. By default it points to the <tt>systemd</tt> executable.
|-
| <span id="root_keydev_var"><tt>root_keydev</tt></span> || {{Path|/dev/disk/by-partuuid/2498f874-ad8f-484e-8aba-81ac1c9665b6}} || <tt>/dev/disk/by-partuuid/${KEYFILEPARTUUID}</tt> || <tt>init</tt> || This specifies the device path of the device on which the keyfile is located. Note that <tt>KEYFILEPARTUUID</tt> defaults to be the same as <tt>EFIPARTUUID</tt>, unless you override it explicitly in {{Path|/etc/buildkernel.conf}}.
|-
| <span id="root_key_var"><tt>root_key</tt></span> || {{Path|luks-key.gpg}} || <tt>${LUKSKEYFILE}</tt> || <tt>init</tt> || This specifies the filename of the LUKS keyfile, held in the top-level directory of the <tt>root_keydev</tt>. If it has a <tt>.gpg</tt> extension (as here), the <tt>init</tt> script will treat it as being a <tt>gpg</tt> encrypted file, and prompt for a passphrase to unlock it (either textually at the console, or using the <tt>plymouth</tt> splash screen manager, if that has been specified).
|-
| <span id="real_resume_var"><tt>real_resume</tt></span> || {{Path|/dev/mapper/vg1-swap}} || <tt>${CMDLINE_REAL_RESUME}</tt> || <tt>init</tt> || This specifies the device path (of a swap volume) to use for resuming (from a hibernation). We use the main LVM-based swap logical volume here. If no resume data has been written to the swap file, a normal boot will take place.
|-
| <tt>keymap</tt> || <tt>jp</tt> || <tt>${KEYMAP}</tt> || <tt>init</tt> || Specifies which keymap to use in early boot. This is important because it will be used when you enter your passphrase, to unlock the <tt>gpg</tt> LUKS keyfile. Note that the appropriate name here is the one used by <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script, ''not'' that used by <tt>systemd</tt> etc. (which won't have been started up yet at the point this variable is referenced). See this [[#keymap_issue|earlier note]] for clarification of this point.
|-
| <span id="quiet_kernel_parameter"><tt>quiet</tt></span> || ''unset'' || ''set if ${PLYMOUTHTHEME} non-empty'' || kernel, <tt>init</tt> || Tells the kernel to suppress most log messages, and also affects some settings within <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script. It is currently unset, but will be set automatically when we specify a <tt>plymouth</tt> theme, later in the tutorial.
|-
| <span id="splash_kernel_parameter"><tt>splash</tt></span> || ''unset'' || ''set if ${PLYMOUTHTHEME} non-empty'' || <tt>init</tt> || Instructs <tt>genkernel</tt>'s init script to use the <tt>plymouth</tt> boot splash system. It is currently unset, but will be set automatically when we specify a <tt>plymouth</tt> theme, later in the tutorial.
|}

If you wish to override any of these, simply set the appropriate variable in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} (of course, per the earlier instructions, you ''must'' at least set <tt>EFIPARTUUID</tt> and <tt>CRYPTPARTUUID</tt>, and possibly <tt>KEYMAP</tt>, to get a bootable kernel). You can also specify additional kernel command line options, in the variable <tt>ADDITIONALKERNELCMDS</tt>. For example, one common additional option you may wish to set would be to <span id="enable_trim">enable passing [[:Wikipedia:Trim_(computing){{!}}TRIM]] commands down to the underlying LUKS partition (if using a solid state drive, to prevent performance degradation as the device fills up). To accomplish this, you would set <tt>ADDITIONALKERNELCMDS="root_trim=yes"</tt> in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}} (this is then passed on by <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script to <tt>cryptsetup</tt>). You can specify multiple additional options via this variable, if you need to; simply separate them with a space.

{{Note|If you do turn TRIM-passthrough on like this, make sure you are comfortable with the possible information leakage it entails (specifically, that it can reveal some disk-usage patterns, allowing filesystem fingerprinting).<ref>SuperUser Forum: [http://superuser.com/questions/302710/trim-support-via-dm-crypt-device-mapper/318847#318847 "TRIM support via dm-crypt/device-mapper"]</ref>}}

=== <span id="genkernel_opts_used_by_buildkernel"><tt>genkernel</tt> Options Used by <tt>buildkernel</tt>, When Creating initramfs</span> ===

The <tt>buildkernel</tt> script calls the Gentoo utility [[Genkernel|<tt>genkernel</tt>]] (from package {{Package|sys-kernel/genkernel-next}}) to create the initramfs. It does this because <tt>genkernel</tt> provides some very useful features, for instance:
* a significantly evolved <tt>init</tt> script, which deals with e.g., the set up of a root directory using LVM over LUKS, prior to handoff to the 'real' init system (<tt>systemd</tt>) on the unlocked root;
* automatic inclusion in the initramfs archive of not only (the minimal set) of necessary binaries, but also the libraries upon which they depend (if dynamically linked);
* dealing with the installation of firmware and kernel modules to the initramfs; and
* managing the use of the <tt>plymouth</tt> boot splash manager, if specified.

<tt>genkernel</tt> is also capable of building the kernel itself, but since it does not provide the UEFI and secure-boot hooks yet, we do not use it for this, preferring our <tt>buildkernel</tt> script instead.

When <tt>buildkernel</tt> invokes <tt>genkernel</tt>, it does so using the following command:  

{{GenericCmd|<pre>
genkernel --install --no-mountboot --luks --lvm  --no-gpg --udev \
    --kernel-config="${TARGETCONFIG}" --busybox \
    --no-compress-initramfs --all-ramdisk-modules --firmware \
    ${PLYMOUTH_OPTS} initramfs</pre>
}}

These options override anything specified in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}}, and have the following description and rationale for use:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! <tt>genkernel</tt> Option / Action!! Description !! Reason Used
|-
| <tt>--install</tt> || Install the initramfs into the {{Path|/boot}} directory after completion. || rowspan=2|In our configuration, {{Path|/boot}} is simply a normal directory, which we use as a convenient marshalling ground (for e.g., the generated initramfs), rather than the mountpoint of the boot partition (which it would be in an [[Partition#Master_Boot_Record_(MBR)|MBR]]-based system). Because it is just a regular directory, though, we have to use the <tt>--no-mountboot</tt> option to prevent <tt>genkernel</tt> from trying to mount it.
|-
| <tt>--no-mountboot</tt> || Do not attempt to mount {{Path|/boot}} automatically.
|-
| <tt>--luks</tt> || Includes LUKS support from  static binaries if they exist on the system. || We have a LUKS encrypted partition that <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script must unlock, so this option is required.
|-
| <tt>--lvm</tt> || Adds LVM support from static binaries, and compiles static LVM binaries if these do not exist. || We have configured root, home and swap on LVM logical volumes (hosted on the LUKS partition), and we need the <tt>init</tt> script to mount these prior to a <tt>switch_root</tt>, so this option is needed. 
|-
| <tt>--no-gpg</tt> || Excludes <tt>gpg</tt> from the initramfs. || This option looks a bit surprising at first glance, as we have used <tt>gpg</tt> to encrypt our LUKS keyfile. We use it because it prevents <tt>genkernel</tt> from copying the v2.x <tt>gpg</tt> binary, and its many library dependencies, into the initramfs, since (as explained [[../Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#pinentry_problem|above]]) the v2.x <tt>gpg</tt> will ''not'' work properly there, given its dependency on a correctly configured <tt>pinentry</tt> service. This option does ''not'' prevent <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script from attempting to use <tt>gpg</tt>, however, and <tt>buildkernel</tt> [[#copy_static_gpg|copies]] our static version of v1.x <tt>gpg</tt> into the initramfs once <tt>genkernel</tt> has built it.
|-
| <tt>--udev</tt> || Adds <tt>udev</tt> support to static binaries if they exist in the system. || This is necessary for correct device management (and therefore, the boot process).
|-
| <tt>--kernel-config="${TARGETCONFIG}"</tt> || Specifies the location of the <tt>.config</tt> file used for the kernel build. || This currently simply points to {{Path|/usr/src/linux/.config}}. Although we don't require <tt>genkernel</tt> to do any kernel compilation for us, we nevertheless set it here for safety.
|-
| <tt>--busybox</tt> || Includes a [[:Wikipedia:BusyBox|<tt>busybox</tt>]] binary in the initramfs. This provides a number of standard Linux tools in a single executable file. || Using this ensures that <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script has access to the necessary external programs it needs in order to run (such as <tt>echo</tt>, <tt>cat</tt> etc.). Once <tt>buildkernel</tt> has run, you can look in {{Path|/boot/initramfs/bin}} for example - many of the programs therein will simply be links to the <tt>busybox</tt> executable.
|-
| <tt>--no-compress-initramfs</tt> || Specifies that the generated initramfs should not be compressed. || When using UEFI, we must use an uncompressed initramfs, hence this option. It is mirrored by the <tt>INITRAMFS_COMPRESSION_NONE</tt> kernel parameter, discussed [[#no_initramfs_compression|earlier]].
|-
| <tt>--all-ramdisk-modules</tt> || Copies <span id="copy_all_modules_to_initramfs">all kernel modules</span> to the initramfs. || This is done for safety, because if a necessary module is missing at boot, your system may not start up properly. In fact, even without this option, <tt>genkernel</tt> will pull what it regards as 'necessary' kernel modules into the initramfs, which will account for a good proportion of them ^-^. Once you have a properly booting system, nothing prevents you from manually disabling unnecessary modules in the [[#make_menuconfig_step|<tt>make menuconfig</tt> step]] of <tt>buildkernel</tt>, and, if you like, turning all others into built-ins, so this option does not imply that you are stuck with a 'bloated' kernel image forever.
|-
| <tt>--firmware</tt> || Copies the firmware (from the default directory of {{Path|/lib/firmware}} into the initramfs. || Many devices will not start up properly without firmware, and so we copy these files over so they are available during early boot. If you have [[#deblob_or_not|chosen to deblob]] your kernel, this option is a no-op.
|-
| <tt>${PLYMOUTH_OPTS}</tt> || Used to specify the <tt>--plymouth</tt> and <tt>--plymouth-theme=${PLYMOUTHTHEME}</tt>, iff <tt>PLYMOUTHTHEME</tt> has been defined to a non-blank value (in {{Path|/etc/buildkernel.conf}}). These options respectively copy support for <tt>plymouth</tt>, and the specified <tt>plymouth</tt> boot theme, into the initramfs. Subsequently, if the <tt>splash</tt> kernel command line parameter is set (see [[#splash_kernel_parameter|above]]), <tt>plymouth</tt> will be activated at boot (by <tt>genkernel</tt>'s <tt>init</tt> script). || The <tt>plymouth</tt> system can be used to provide a graphical boot screen, replacing the usual textual console. This will automatically be turned on by <tt>buildkernel</tt> if you uncomment the <tt>PLYMOUTHTHEME</tt> variable in {{Path|/etc/genkernel.conf}}. We ''will'' turn this on later; however, at the current point in the tutorial, it should be left commented out.
|-
| <tt>initramfs</tt> || Instructs <tt>genkernel</tt> to build only the initramfs. || <tt>buildkernel</tt> does its own kernel compilation, so the only the initramfs construction ability of <tt>genkernel</tt> is needed.
|}

That concludes our brief tour through some of the internals of <tt>buildkernel</tt>. Now we can get on and use it!

This will take some time to complete during the first pass, since all kernel components must be built from scratch. Subsequent runs of <tt>buildkernel</tt> should complete much more quickly, provided you answer {{Key|n}} when prompted if you want to <tt>make clean</tt> (there's generally no need to <tt>make clean</tt>, unless you experience some strange build problems, or are building a new version for the first time). Furthermore, the next time you run <tt>buildkernel</tt>, it will use the configuration now saved in the {{Path|/usr/src/linux/.config}} file, rather than the currently running kernel's configuration (read from {{Path|/proc/config.gz}}).
{{Note|As the warnings at the end of the run indicate, because you are ''currently'' not booted using EFI, <tt>buildkernel</tt> cannot access the EFI boot list persistent variable. However, on most machines, you can use the BIOS GUI to specify that it should run an EFI executable from a USB key (and we'll do this shortly). Once the machine ''is'' booted in EFI, subsequent runs of <tt>buildkernel</tt> will ensure that an entry for any newly built kernel is present on the EFI boot list, and at the top of the boot order.}}

{{Note|The default Gentoo kernel configuration from the minimal-install system, on which this first build is based, has a ''lot'' of kernel modules specified for build. This is to ensure that the resulting system will work on a wide range of hardware. There's no need to take any action yet, but as [[../Final_Configuration_Steps#cleaning_kernel_config{{!}}discussed later on]], feel free to pare back the number of unnecessary modules created - this will reduce your build time, and decrease your attack surface for exploits. You can easily switch modules off using the standard <tt>make menuconfig</tt> editor - simply press {{Key|y}} when <tt>buildkernel</tt> prompts you
{{GenericCmd| <span style{{=}}"color:green;">*</span> Would you like to modify the configuration using the editor (y/n)?}} A brief introduction to using the <tt>make menuconfig</tt> system can be found [[Kernel/Configuration#Usage|here]] and [[Kernel/Gentoo_Kernel_Configuration_Guide#Kernel_configuration_shorthand_notation|here]]. However, there is no need to perform any kernel configuration editing at this point in the tutorial.}}
{{Note|If you do choose to use the graphical kernel configuration editor when running over <tt>ssh</tt>, be aware that you may get some pretty strange characters showing up on the display, if the locale on your helper machine (which <tt>sshd</tt> will try to import) is not present on the target (in the host, not the <tt>chroot</tt>, since the former is the context the <tt>sshd</tt> is running).<ref name{{=}}"set_locale_failed">ServerFault Q&A Site: [http://serverfault.com/questions/304469/setting-locale-failed-force-certain-locale-when-connecting-through-ssh "Setting locale failed: force certain locale when connecting through ssh"]</ref> You can always get around this by opening another chroot directly on the target machine (i.e. using the target's keyboard), and issuing your <tt>buildkernel</tt> command from there. The issue should not be present once the system is fully configured.}}
{{Note|On a minor hygiene point, note that <tt>buildkernel</tt> performs the kernel build as root. To be fair, this is the same approach taken by the [[Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Kernel#Default:_Manual_configuration|default manual configuration]] in the Gentoo handbook, so I have left it this way for simplicity.}}
{{Note|The files produced by the build differ a little from the layout you may be used to from an [[Partition#Master_Boot_Record_(MBR){{!}}MBR]]-based boot system. For example, only the stub-loadable bootable kernel image and its configuration file are copied to the system partition on the USB boot key. A <tt>System.map</tt> file ''is'' produced, but it is left in the {{Path|/boot}} directory (which, as has already been mentioned, in our case is just a regular directory, used as a marshalling yard, with no significance during the UEFI boot process itself). To be precise: 
* the kernel used for boot is placed in {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi}} (this path is configurable), and a copy is kept at {{Path|/boot/vmlinuz-<version>-gentoo}}; the kernel is an x86 boot executable [[:Wikipedia:Vmlinux#bzImage{{!}}bzImage]] - it behaves like an EFI executable (as it has been built with [[#enable_efi_stub{{!}}EFI stub loader]] support), but it is still a regular kernel that we could load with a normal bootloader outside of EFI, if we chose);<ref>Ask Ubuntu: [http://askubuntu.com/questions/330541/what-is-vmlinuz-efi#330615 What is vmlinuz.efi?]</ref><ref name="efi_stub"/>
* the configuration file for that kernel is at {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/config}} (for reference only, it isn't needed to boot), and a copy is at {{Path|/boot/config-<version>-gentoo}}; when booted a live version is available at {{Path|/proc/config.gz}};
* the system map is at {{Path|/boot/System.map-<version>-gentoo}} (and {{Path|/usr/src/linux/System.map}}); also, when booted, a live version is available at {{Path|/proc/kallsyms}};
* for UEFI (secure) booting, the initramfs is encapsulated inside the kernel, but:
** a copy of the ''initial'' (pre-modification) initramfs is kept at {{Path|/boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-<version>-gentoo}}; 
** a copy of the ''final'', post-modification initramfs is kept at {{Path|/boot/initramfs.cpio}}, and
** an unpacked copy of the latter is maintained at {{Path|/boot/initramfs}}, for ease of reference.
Note that the {{Path|/boot/efi}} path is a mountpoint for the EFI system partition on the boot USB key, and this should generally be kept unmounted when not building (<tt>buildkernel</tt>, as above, will automatically mount it for you, and offer to unmount at the end of the build). You can of course manually mount the EFI system partition if desired.}}
{{Note|If <span id{{=}}use_previous_kernel>a previous kernel</span> and config are present in the {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/Boot}} directory when <tt>buildkernel</tt> is run, they will be renamed with an <tt>.old</tt> suffix (so, to {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/boox64.efi.old}} and {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/config.old}}, respectively). We haven't booted off this new kernel yet, but once we have, this allows us to revert back to the previous version, in case changes made have caused a boot problem. The EFI partition is simply <tt>fat32</tt> and so can be accessed from most machines, including Windows boxes. Simply rename or remove the problematic kernel and config, rename the {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/boox64.efi.old}} to {{Path|/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/boox64.efi}} (and rename the config too, if you wish), and reboot. Of course, this is simply a hint for use in the future - you don't need to do anything like that at this point in the tutorial!}}
{{Note|In the default kernel command line produced by <tt>buildkernel</tt>, [[:Wikipedia:Trim_(computing){{!}}TRIM]] has not been activated for the LUKS partition (this is a feature which can prevent performance degradation when using solid-state drives). If you wish to enable it, see these instructions [[#enable_trim{{!}}above]].}}
{{Note|When you upgrade your portage tree (discussed later), if you find that a new version of {{Package|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources}} has become available, then you can very easily use <tt>buildkernel</tt> to upgrade your kernel (the instructions below will work off your running kernel's configuration as a basis to start with). Simply issue:
{{RootCmd
|eselect kernel list
}}
to view the available kernel versions, followed by:
{{RootCmd
|eselect kernel set N
}}
to choose the new one (remember to substitute the appropriate number for <tt>N</tt> here, generally it will be the number for the last item in the list just displayed), followed by:
{{RootCmd
|buildkernel --verbose
}}
which will run the process in non-interactive mode. See the <tt>buildkernel</tt> manpage for more details. Alternatively, you could use the <tt>genup</tt> script, which will handle updating all packages ''and'' your kernel automatically (we will introduce this utility [[../Configuring_systemd_and_Installing_Necessary_Tools#ensure_system_up_to_date|later in the tutorial]]).

However, there is no action you need to take at this point.
}}
{{Note|To run <tt>buildkernel</tt> in {{Highlight|non-interactive mode}}, simply omit the <tt>--ask</tt> option. For example, to achieve the same effect as the interactive command [[#first_buildkernel{{!}}above]], you could instead have issued:
{{RootCmd
|buildkernel --verbose --clean --unmount-at-end
|prompt=<span style{{=}}"color:gray;">(chroot)</span> livecd <span style{{=}}"color:royalblue;">/ #</span>
}}
See the <tt>buildkernel</tt> manpage for more details.
