{{Metadata|abstract=sshguard is an intrusion prevention system which parses server logs, determines malicious activity and then uses the system firewall to block those ip addresses.}}

<!--T:2-->
'''sshguard''' is an intrusion prevention system.  sshguard parses server logs, determines malicious activity, and then bans malicious users via firewall rules.  sshguard is written in C so it does not tax an interprator.

== How it works == <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
The {{Package|app-admin/sshguard}} package is a simple daemon which continuously tracks one or more log files. It parses the log events that daemons send out in case of failed login attempts and then blocks any further attempts of those users by updating the system's firewall.

<!--T:5-->
Unlike what the name implies, sshguard does not only parse SSH logs. It also supports many mail systems as well as a few FTP ones. A full listing of supported services can be found on the [http://www.sshguard.net sshguard.net website].

== Configuration == <!--T:6-->

=== Software === <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
Install {{Package|app-admin/sshguard}}:

<!--T:9-->
{{Emerge|app-admin/sshguard}}

<!--T:10-->
Also make sure that {{Package|net-firewall/iptables}} is installed and used as the system firewall. At the time of writing, sshguard does not support {{Package|net-firewall/nftables}} yet.

<!--T:11-->
{{Emerge|net-firewall/iptables}}

<!--T:12-->
More information about using and configuring [[Iptables|iptables]] can also be found on the Gentoo wiki.

=== Preparing the firewall === <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
When sshguard blocks any malicious users (by blocking their IP addresses), it will use the <tt>sshguard</tt> chain.

<!--T:15-->
Prepare the chain, and make sure it is also triggered when new incoming connections are detected:

<!--T:16-->
{{RootCmd|iptables -N sshguard
|iptables -A INPUT -j sshguard}}

=== Watching logfiles === <!--T:17-->

<!--T:18-->
The basic idea behind sshguard is that the administrator passes on the log file(s) to watch as options to the application - there is no native sshguard configuration file.

<!--T:19-->
On Gentoo, the options can be best configured in the {{Path|/etc/conf.d/sshguard}} file:

<!--T:20-->
{{FileBox|filename=/etc/conf.d/sshguard|title=Configuring sshguard to read /var/log/messages|lang=bash|1=
PARDONTIME="3600" # Blocks last at least 1 hour (3600 seconds)
WATCHTIME="360"   # Track IP addresses for 5 minutes (360 seconds)
THRESHOLD="10"    # How many problematic attempts trigger a block
  
LOGFILES="-l /var/log/messages"                      # Watch this file...
LOGFILES="${SSHGUARD_LOGFILES} -l /var/log/auth.log" # And this one
  
SSHGUARD_OPTS="-p ${PARDONTIME} -s ${WATCHTIME} -a ${THRESHOLD} ${LOGFILES}"
}}

<!--T:21-->
Make sure that the log files are accessible for the runtime user that sshguard uses.

=== Service === <!--T:22-->

<!--T:23-->
Have sshguard be started by default by adding it to the default runlevel, and then start it:

<!--T:24-->
{{RootCmd|rc-update add sshguard default
|rc-service sshguard start}}
