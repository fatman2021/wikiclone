<!--T:1-->
This FAQ should help users avoid some common installation and configuration issues related to DRI and X11 for AMD/ATI boards.

== Hardware Support == <!--T:2-->

=== Is my AMD/ATI board supported? === <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
Many AMD/ATI boards (but not all) are supported by [http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/xorg xorg-x11], at least for the 2D accelerated features. The 3D support is provided either by xorg-x11, or by AMD's [http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/ati-catalyst/Pages/catalyst.aspx closed source drivers]. AMD's closed source driver only supports R600 and newer GPUs. Older GPUs will use the mature open source xorg-x11 driver.

{{Note|The [http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature Radeon Feature Matrix] at x.org lists the open source driver support level for each part of the graphics card hardware.}}

=== I have an All-In-Wonder/Vivo board.  Are the multimedia features supported? === <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
You don't need to use anything special for the board's multimedia features; {{Package|x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati}} will work just fine. 

=== I'm not using an x86-based architecture.  What are my options? === <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
X11 support on the PPC or Alpha platforms is quite similar to x86 X11 support. However, AMD/ATI's closed source Catalyst drivers are not supported on the PPC or Alpha, so you will have to use the open source drivers. The Catalyst drivers are only available for x86 and AMD64. The open source xorg-x11 drivers should work well on all architectures. 

<!--T:11-->
{{Important|To enable agpgart support for certain old AMD64 chipsets, you have to disable support for the K8 IOMMU.}}

=== I have a laptop. Is my ATI Mobility model supported? === <!--T:12-->

<!--T:13-->
It should be, but you may have a configuration issue due to the OEM PCI id that such chips may have. In such cases, you may have to write the configuration file yourself. 

== Installation == <!--T:14-->

=== Packages === <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
There are two ways of getting drivers for your AMD/ATI card: 

<!--T:17-->
* The <code>xorg-x11</code> ebuild provides the X11 implementation
* The <code>ati-drivers</code> ebuild provides the AMD closed source X drivers and kernel modules

<!--T:18-->
If you want to use AMD/ATI's ''internal'' agpgart support instead of the Linux kernel one, the agpgart driver and the chip set specific driver (in your kernel configuration) must be built as modules or not at all. 

<!--T:19-->
{{Note|Please read the [http://www.gentoo.org//doc/en/dri-howto.xml Hardware Acceleration Guide] for more information on installing drivers for your AMD/ATI graphics card.}}

=== Configuration === <!--T:20-->

<!--T:21-->
You may not need to manually create {{Path|xorg.conf}} or modify it if you are using the open-source radeon driver. Try running without it first. If this fails, you can use the auto-configuration option of X: 

<!--T:22-->
{{RootCmd|X -configure}}

<!--T:23-->
If you use the proprietary ATI drivers, you can get assistance for configuring X through the <code>aticonfig</code> application (which is part of the {{Package|x11-drivers/ati-drivers}} package). See [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Fglrx fglrx] for more information.

<!--T:24-->
For more information on how to get a basic <code>xorg.conf</code> configuration file, please refer to the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xorg/Configuration Gentoo X Server HowTo] . 

<!--T:25-->
{{Note|PPC, AMD64, and x86 users can use the <code>xac</code> stand-alone X configuration tool by emerging {{Package|x11-misc/xac}}, but isn't required.}}

<!--T:26-->
{{Important|If you're using <code>ati-drivers</code> , then you'll need to disable <code>radeonfb</code> (and probably any other framebuffer drivers) in your kernel config, as it conflicts with the built-in framebuffer in <code>ati-drivers</code> .}}

=== Switching to OpenGL === <!--T:27-->

<!--T:28-->
Once X is installed, configured, and running, it can use the AMD/ATI OpenGL libraries: 

<!--T:29-->
{{RootCmd|eselect opengl set ati}}

== More Resources == <!--T:30-->
