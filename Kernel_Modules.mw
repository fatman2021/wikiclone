This page is meant to help picking between compile-in-kernel ("<*>") and compile-as-module ("<M>") when configuring a Linux kernel.

__TOC__

== Advantages ==
A module ..
* is loadable without reboot (at least most of them)
* results in smaller kernel memory footprint (when the module is not loaded)
* can be loaded on demand by [[udev]] (for example DVB drivers for DVB stick)
* allows easy reloading of kernel drivers in case of module crash
* allows specifying module-specific parameters in /etc/conf.d/modules

== Drawbacks ==
Using a module ..
* may need an update of the initramfs for modules needed early (i.e. filesystem)
* may result in minimal performance loss due to addition of api layer and slight more memory usage

Also:
* Beware of file system module X located on a partition formatted with X (unbootable system at worst)
