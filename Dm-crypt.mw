'''dm-crypt''' is a disk encryption system using the kernels crypto API framework and device mapper. dm-crypt is cappable of encrypting whole disks, logical volumes, single files and RAID volumes.

== Kernel Configuration ==
To use dm-crypt the certain kernel options must be built-in such as any hashing functions or stream ciphers that are to be used to encrypt the volume, a [[filesystem]] that is to be applied to the encrypted volume such as [[ext4]], loopback device support and [[initramfs]] support. For a basic configuration SHA256 and MD5 hashes are generally built into the kernel by default along with the AES cipher, if different alogrithms are required these can be found under the Cryptographic API section. This is an example of a basic kernel configuration.

{{Kernel||<pre>
General setup  --->
    [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
[*] Enable loadable module support
    Device Drivers --->
        [*] Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->
            <*> Device mapper support
            <*> Crypt target support
        [*] Block Devices --->
            <*>  Loopback device support
[*] Cryptographic API --->
    <*> SHA224 and SHA256 digest algorithm
</pre>}}

Most of the Gentoo install media will have the basic modules built in by default, however more custom modules such as Whirlpool hashes are not included, but can easily be built then loaded.

== Configuring Encrypted Volume ==
For this example the volume will be  a plain partition (/dev/sda1).

* Load kernel modules appropriate to your setup
: {{RootCmd|modprobe {dm-mod,dm-crypt,aes,sha256,cbc} }}

* Generate key
: {{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/dev/urandom of{{=}}keyFile bs{{=}}1024 count{{=}}4}}

* Fill volume with random bits/shred (optional)
: {{RootCmd|shred -v -n 2 /dev/sda1}}
: or
: {{RootCmd|dd if{{=}}/dev/urandom of{{=}}/dev/sda1 bs{{=}}1M}}

* cryptsetup luksFormat
: For keyFile based auth
: {{RootCmd|cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1 keyFile}}

: For password based auth
: {{RootCmd|cryptsetup -y luksFormat /dev/sda1}}

* cryptsetup open
: For keyFile based auth
: {{RootCmd|cryptsetup -d keyFile luksOpen /dev/sda1 encVol}}

: For password based auth
: {{RootCmd|cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 encVol}}

* mkfs, using ext4 in this case
: {{RootCmd|mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/encVol}}

* mount
: {{RootCmd|mount /dev/mapper/encVol MOUNTPOINT}}

== Initrd config For Wholedisk Encryption ==
The easiest option for booting an encrypted root partition is to use [[dracut]]. To configure dracut for dm-crypt make sure to include the ''crypt'' module. Follow the dracut article making sure to include the ''crypt'' module along with any others required:
{{File|/etc/portage/make.conf||<pre>
DRACUT_MODULES="... crypt ..."
</pre>}}
