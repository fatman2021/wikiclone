===== Wi-Fi drivers: =====
Compile and install [http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/brcm80211 brcmsmac driver] from linux kernel.

{{RootCmd|Linux config, options|output=<pre>
Device Drivers --->

<M> BCMA support

And install the ebuild ''sys-kernel/linux-firmware'' to get the required firmware.

==== Graphics and video decoding: ====

The laptop includes an Intel Sandy-Bridge GPU that supports VA API. Sadly, this standard is not recognize for many applications, but you can install the great [https://github.com/i-rinat/libvdpau-va-gl libvdpau-va-gl] to get the video decoding by hardware works for VDPAU, a standard more extended. See this blog entry: [http://davidrosca.blogspot.com.es/2013/05/va-api-backend-for-vdpau.html VA API Backend for VDPAU]

==== Touchpad and keyboard layout config: ====
Make a ''/etc/X11/xorg.conf'' to config the synaptics touchpad and keyboard layout (in my case, Spanish)
