Booting Gentoo from a USB stick is really quite simple, to make it work properly though you need to setup an initial ramdisk and you will need to make sure you have drivers for all the machines you are going to boot with it. This article will describe how to install Gentoo onto a USB stick that can be booted in any computer. This installation will be just like your desktop installation and changes will be persistent.

== Preparation ==
Before one begins, some packages are needed. It is assumed that you are running on a Gentoo system to create this bootable USB stick. Most importantly a kernel and the {{package|sys-kernel/genkernel}} package are needed.

{{emerge|sys-kernel/gentoo-sources|sys-kernel/genkernel}}

To add package-specific useflags, you may need to make a new file in {{path|/etc/portage/package.use/}}:
{{File|/etc/portage/package.use/sys-apps||<pre>
sys-apps/busybox static
</pre>}}

{{emerge|sys-apps/busybox}}

== Compile the kernel ==
Make the required changes to your kernel and compile it. Please see [[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=7|section 7 of the handbook]] and [[Kernel/Configuration]] for more detail on this step. Importantly remember that a general kernel is better here because the more general it is the more machines will boot with it. You can still compile modules as these will be included in the [[initramfs]] and loaded at boot.

{{RootCmd|mkdir /tmp/boot}}

<pre>genkernel --firmware --busybox --disklabel --bootdir=/tmp/boot --no-symlink --all-ramdisk-modules --install all</pre>

The above command will take some time as it will build the default kernel and create a ramdisk then copy them into {{path|/tmp/boot}}.

{{RootCmd|ls /tmp/boot/
|output=<pre>
initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.5.2-gentoo
kernel-genkernel-x86_64-3.5.2-gentoo
System.map-genkernel-x86_64-3.5.2-gentoo
</pre>}}

== Prepare the USB stick ==
Create 2 partitions on the drive (you can probably do it with one but it is normal practice to create a {{path|/boot}} and a {{path|/}} (root) partition. It is assumed that your USB stick is {{path|/dev/sdb}}. Adjust as necessary.

{{RootCmd|fdisk /dev/sdb
|output=<pre>
Command (m for help): d

Command (m for help): n

   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended

Command (m for help): w

</pre>}}

Make sure that the first partition is bootable (a command toggles the boot flag).

Now format the new partitions to the ext2 file system (but you can use another file system for the / partition if it has support in your kernel). Notice that we have given the drives a label, this is important because it will be how we detect the root file system later, you also notice <tt>--disklabel</tt> on the genkernel command line earlier.

{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext2 -L GENTOO_USB_BOOT /dev/sdb1}}
{{RootCmd|mkfs.ext2 -L GENTOO_USB_ROOT /dev/sdb2}}

== Stage 3 installation ==
The kernel is ready, the initial ramdisk is ready and our file systems have been created and labelled, now we need some shell utilities and such. This is all contained in the stage3 tarball available from your nearest Gentoo mirror... and portage snapshot.

* [[http://mirror.bytemark.co.uk/gentoo/releases/amd64/current-stage3/|current-stage3]]
* [[http://mirror.bytemark.co.uk/gentoo/snapshots/portage-latest.tar.xz|portage-latest]]

For this example <tt>stage3-amd64-20120621.tar.bz2</tt> and <tt>portage-latest.tar.xz</tt> were downloaded. This next bit is the same as in the handbook for installing Gentoo.

{{RootCmd|mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/gentoo}}
{{RootCmd|cd /mnt/gentoo}}
{{RootCmd|tar -xpf ~/Download/stage3-amd64-20120621.tar.bz2}}
{{RootCmd|cd usr}}
{{RootCmd|tar -xpf ~/Download/portage-latest.tar.xz}}
{{RootCmd|mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/gentoo/boot}}
{{RootCmd|cp /tmp/boot/* /mnt/gentoo/boot}}

== Chrooting ==
Now we are going to chroot into the Gentoo environment...

{{RootCmd|mount -t proc none /mnt/gentoo/proc}}
{{RootCmd|mount -o bind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev}}
{{RootCmd|cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/gentoo/resolv.conf}}
{{RootCmd|chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash}}

== Bootloader ==

So that you can boot the new system you must install a bootloader onto your USB stick. You have many options for this, but here I will just run through {{lilo}} and {{syslinux}}.

== lilo Bootloader Configuration ==

{{RootCmd|emerge sys-boot/lilo}}

Edit {{path|etc/lilo.conf}} so that it has the correct information in it now.

{{Warning|These settings are very important and will be discussed line by line. If you get this wrong you might break your current Linux installation.}}

{{File|/etc/lilo.conf|Configure lilo.conf|<pre>
boot=/dev/sdb              # The location of your USB Stick
lba32                      # use lba32 addressing (ignore)
compact                    # boot quickly by loading lots of blocks
                           # remove if you have problems booting
prompt                     # Prompt for user input
timeout=20                 # Time to wait before default selection
default="Gentoo-352"       # Default selection after timeout

image=/boot/kernel-genkernel-x86_64-3.5.2-gentoo
	label="Gentoo-352"
	read-only
	root=/dev/ram0
	append="real_root=LABEL=GENTOO_USB_ROOT scandelay=5"
	initrd=/boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.5.2-gentoo
</pre>}}

The lines after image are all easy but the append line contains some interesting options. <tt>REAL_ROOT=LABEL=GENTOO_USB_ROOT</tt> will use the label of the disk instead of {{path|/dev/sdb2}} which is important because these device numbers move around depending on the number of hard disks in the computer or number of USB disk drives. Also important for USB booting is the <tt>scandelay</tt>, as USB devices need a little time to be detected by the kernel; that is what this option is for. When you have lots of modules booting takes a long time so it probably does not matter, but if you have only a few it is important, because the system could have booted before the kernel detects the USB device. Also, on newer machines with USB3 controllers you will need the <tt>xhci_hcd</tt> driver (built into the kernel or as a module).

{{RootCmd|lilo
|output=<pre>
gentoohost boot # lilo
Warning: /dev/sdb is not on the first disk
Warning: The initial RAM disk is too big to fit between the kernel and
   the 15M-16M memory hole.  It will be loaded in the highest memory as
   though the configuration file specified "large-memory" and it will
   be assumed that the BIOS supports memory moves above 16M.
Added Gentoo-352 ? *
2 warnings were issued.</pre>}}

The first warning is to be expected as we are not installing the boot loader onto the hard disk in your computer. The second warning will only cause a problem on machines that are old, if it is a problem for you try cutting down the kernel by removing modules.

== syslinux Bootloader Configuration ==

{{RootCmd|emerge syslinux}}

Put the boot sector onto your USB stick.

{{RootCmd|dd bs=404 count=1 conv=notrunc if=/usr/share/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdb}}

Now to configure the bootloader, to do this we use a text editor:

{{RootCmd|mkdir /boot/syslinux}}

{{File|/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg||<pre>
PROMPT 1
TIMEOUT 50
DEFAULT gentoo
 
LABEL gentoo
        LINUX ../kernel-genkernel-x86_64-3.5.2-gentoo
        APPEND root=LABEL=GENTOO_USB_ROOT scandelay=3 ro
        INITRD ../initramfs--genkernel-x86_64-3.5.2-gentoo
</pre>}}

Then to install syslinux onto your USB stick, device is not absolutely necessary but will throw an error if you make a mistake (not that we ever make mistakes ;-) ).

{{RootCmd|extlinux --device /dev/sdb1 --install /boot/syslinux}}

== fstab Configuration ==

{{File|/etc/fstab|Configure your fstab to work with labels|<pre>
LABEL=GENTOO_USB_BOOT   /boot           ext2            noauto,noatime  1 2
LABEL=GENTOO_USB_ROOT   /               ext2            noatime         0 1
/dev/SWAP               none            swap            sw              0 0
/dev/cdrom              /mnt/cdrom      auto            noauto,ro       0 0
/dev/fd0                /mnt/floppy     auto            noauto          0 0
</pre>}}

Set the password for the root user and that is it. Exit the chroot environment and unmount all the mounts you made before going into it.

== Setting the root password ==
The stage3 tarball we used comes with a password... I don't now what that password is and you should change it anyway, before leaving your chroot make sure to set it to something you know so that you can login to your new system.

{{RootCmd|passwd}}

== Locale and other configurations ==
The locale configuration is left up to you, it is quite easy and covered in the handbook. But don't skip this step!

== Little tips ==
Although you can use the system we just made as a standard Gentoo system, if you are using a USB stick rather than a hard drive it might be worthwhile compiling binary packages on a host and then installing then pulling them on in binary form... or if you have enough memory just mount <tt>/var/tmp</tt> to a tmpfs, as compilation will be quicker that way anyway!

== That is all ==
You should now be able to boot your shiny new Gentoo system from the USB drive.

{{Note|Although an amd64 system was used here to do this, it will work just the same way for a 32-bit x86 machine.}}
