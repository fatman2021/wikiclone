== Enabling antialiased fonts for Emacs ==

=== Installation and setup ===
{{Note|Font anti-aliasing using the Xft library and FreeType fonts is available with Emacs 23 or later.}}
First, set the appropriate USE flags – you ''must'' have the <code>xft</code> flag.
{{RootCmd|echo "app-editors/emacs xft" >> /etc/portage/package.use}}

Now it's time to install Emacs:
{{Emerge|app-editors/emacs}}

You can now use XFT fonts in emacs; try emerging {{Package|media-fonts/ttf-bitstream-vera}} first.
{{Cmd|emacs --font 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-12'}}

If you're happy with this as your default font, set it in your {{Path|~/.Xresources}}:
{{Cmd
|echo "Emacs.font: Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-12" >> ~/.Xresources
|xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
}}
